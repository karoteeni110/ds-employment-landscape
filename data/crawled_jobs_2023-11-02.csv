Who are we?We are a Finnish-based international New Space company with employees from more than 57 countries in Finland, the US, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, and Poland. Our team is a tight-knit group of experts from areas including engineering, software development, and radar technology. We're innovative, driven people who strive for excellence in everything we do. Being advocates of our corporate culture, we value teamwork and curiosity, and we know how to have fun!What do we do?ICEYE is building and operating its commercial constellation of small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with SAR data available to customers. Our satellites acquire images of Earth at any time - even when it's cloudy or dark - providing commercial and government partners with unmatched persistent monitoring capabilities. Information derived from our SAR images helps customers make data-driven decisions to address time-critical challenges in various sectors, such as maritime, disaster management, insurance, and finance.Need for the roleThe ICEYE satellite constellation produces a huge amount of telemetry everyday. Inspection of near real time telemetry is crucial for operating satellites. Long-term telemetry analysis helps to understand the behavior of the spacecraft, debug sudden anomalies and provide feedback to the existing operational procedure as well as the design of new satellites.The work of Spacecraft Engineers and Satellite Operators require easy access to both short term and long term telemetry. Hence, there is a need for processing, storing and exposing the huge amount of telemetry in a meaningful way to our users so that they can focus on their strengths i.e analyzing the behavior of the satellite subsystems or monitoring of the spacecraft's health. With the growing numbers of the satellites, it is also neither possible to monitor all the telemetry parameters for each satellite separately nor carry out similar analysis manually every now and then. This brings the need of automation and creation of an intelligent satellite health monitoring system with necessary alerting features.ResponsibilitiesYou will work as a member of the Telemetry Team focusing primarily on the on-ground handling of the telemetry databases produced on-board. Development of highly scalable and resilient storage, services/data pipelines for both short term and long term telemetry analysis use cases. Build API to expose data to users. Understanding telemetry use cases from the users' perspective is important to build meaningful API for them. Development of a post-processing telemetry warehouse platform to allow meaningful data reduction and visualization.Develop a meaningful satellite configuration management system for ease of fleet handling and automation.Promote the use of meaningful data archiving techniques.Improve the data quality and reliability of the pipeline through proper monitoring and failure handling.Take active part in architecture-related discussions.Drive process discovery and resolution of technical blockers; generate ideas, and identify / solve problems.Produce simple, high quality clean code using frameworks, services, and reusable assets where possible.
Prior experience of working with satellite telemetry is not mandatory, but knowledge of working with large data-oriented software development is crucial for the successful completion of your day to day work. You shall be expected to analyze the data and develop software services for it.RequirementsYour work would include design, development and maintenance of both software and infrastructure solutions for an end to end complex data solution. So, overall this role is a mixture of Data Engineering with an interest towards Data Science knowledge. Work/proven experience in data-oriented software engineering ( 3-5 years)Excellent experience with data processing/analysis libraries (e.g. numpy, pandas, etc) and programming skill (Python)Understanding of Time Series Data Analysis and Visualization TechniquesInterest towards understanding satellite subsystems and generated telemetryGood communication skill to participate in cross departmental projectsComfortable finding his/her own way and living well in the continuous stream of change that is inevitable in a start-up that is beginning to scaleExpertise in non-relational and relational databases, understanding how different data structures can affect the performance
You are expected to work with the environment/tools listed below. Thus, in order to ramp up the work, a certain level of prior knowledge and willingness to learn more is required. Experience in distributed clusters and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)Experience in API development (RESTful API)Basic knowledge of infrastructure as a code (Terraform, Ansible) for resource and service provisioningExperience in cloud based development (AWS)Dedication to code quality, automation and operational excellence: CI/CD pipelines(Github actions), unit/integration testsGeneral understanding of good software development practices
Nice to have: Knowledge of Machine Learning conceptsFamiliarity with GraphQLExperience of working with Time Series DB (InfluxDB is an extra plus!)Experience with building Data WarehouseExperience with Apache Spark, Dask, or any similar data processing frameworkExperience with handling Satellite Data (of any kind)
BenefitsWhat we offer: A job that matters in a dynamic New Space environment with a scale-up approachAn independent role with a supportive and diverse work environmentOccupational healthcare, occupational and private insuranceA yearly benefit budget to spend as you wish (i.e. on sport, transport, wellness, lunch, etc.)Relocation support (i.e. flight tickets, accommodation, relocation buddy program)Time for self-development, research, training, conferences, or certification schemesInspiring and collaborating offices and silent workspaces enabling you to focusRegular internal events for employees (e.g. sports events, team-building events, parties, etc.)A wide variety of best coffee, tea, snacks, and sweets to accompany your daily space mission

Odotukset ylittävää datavetoista liiketoimintaaHaluatko päästä osaksi mielenkiintoista tarinaamme, jossa pääset työskentelemään paremman datan ja luotettavamman huomisen puolesta?Epical on pohjoismainen datakonsultointiyritys, jonka tavoitteena on luoda maailma, johon me kaikki voimme luottaa. Meidän missiomme on määritellä uudelleen, mitä datakonsultointi voi olla ja mitä sen avulla on mahdollista saavuttaa. Oikeissa käsissä datan voima voi muuttaa elämän paremmaksi. Luottamus on tekemisemme ydin. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että datakonsultteina näemme roolimme ulottuvan neuvonnan ja palvelujen ulkopuolelle. Koska tiedämme, että digitaalisen luottamuksen, datan ja analytiikan, sovellusten ja integraatioiden asiantuntijuus on muutakin kuin teknistä tietämystä. Se on vastuu ja mahdollisuus auttaa ohjaamaan, muokkaamaan ja tekemään maailmasta oikeudenmukaisempaa meille kaikille.Mitä tulet tekemään?Data & Analytics -liiketoiminnallamme on pitkä kokemus analyyttisista sovelluksista, joissa suurten tietomassojen käsittely ja hallinta ovat arkipäivää. Suunnittelemme ja toteutamme asiakkaillemme tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, jotka palvelevat ja mahdollistavat monipuolisen tiedon hyödyntämisen suoraan liiketoiminnan tarpeisiin. Valitsemme käyttämämme teknologiat aina asiakastarpeen mukaisesti, mutta hyödynnämme ratkaisuissamme erityisesti Azurea.Työssäsi pääset varmistamaan, että asiakkaamme hyödyntävät keräämäänsä dataa mahdollisimman tehokkaasti. Suunnittelet uusia tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, ja työskentelet asiakasprojekteissamme tai pienkehitystehtävissä. Työskentelet keskimäärin kahdessa projektissa kerrallaan ja projektien kesto vaihtelee muutamasta kuukaudesta vuoteen. Rooliasi voidaan muotoilla osaamisesi ja tavoitteidesi mukaisesti: voit huolehtia asiakkaidemme datasta aina tietovarastoinnista raportointiin saakka tai syventyä esimerkiksi tietoarkkitehtuureihin, mastertiedon hallintaan, tietomallinnukseen, tietovarastointiin tai projektinhallintaan. Työviikkoihin kuuluu käytännön kehitystyön lisäksi yhteistyötä ja erilaisia tapaamisia kollegoiden ja asiakkaan kanssa.Työntekopaikkasi on osaavassa porukassa Espoon, Lahden tai Tampereen toimistoillamme, mutta jos olet kokenut osaaja, onnistuu työn tekeminen etänä mistä tahansa Suomessa. Toki välillä voi tulla tilanteita, että koko tiimi tekee töitä myös asiakkaan tiloissa. Löydät aina kokenutta sparrailuseuraa useista eri tiimeistämme ja työskenteletkin noin 150 ammattilaisemme ja eri asiantuntijatiimiemme kanssa Suomessa ja Ruotsissa.

Odotukset ylittävää datavetoista liiketoimintaaHaluatko päästä osaksi mielenkiintoista tarinaamme, jossa pääset työskentelemään paremman datan ja luotettavamman huomisen puolesta?Epical on pohjoismainen datakonsultointiyritys, jonka tavoitteena on luoda maailma, johon me kaikki voimme luottaa. Meidän missiomme on määritellä uudelleen, mitä datakonsultointi voi olla ja mitä sen avulla on mahdollista saavuttaa. Oikeissa käsissä datan voima voi muuttaa elämän paremmaksi. Luottamus on tekemisemme ydin. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että datakonsultteina näemme roolimme ulottuvan neuvonnan ja palvelujen ulkopuolelle. Koska tiedämme, että digitaalisen luottamuksen, datan ja analytiikan, sovellusten ja integraatioiden asiantuntijuus on muutakin kuin teknistä tietämystä. Se on vastuu ja mahdollisuus auttaa ohjaamaan, muokkaamaan ja tekemään maailmasta oikeudenmukaisempaa meille kaikille. Mitä tulet tekemään?Data & Analytics -liiketoiminnallamme on pitkä kokemus analyyttisista sovelluksista, joissa suurten tietomassojen käsittely ja hallinta ovat arkipäivää. Suunnittelemme ja toteutamme asiakkaillemme tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, jotka palvelevat ja mahdollistavat monipuolisen tiedon hyödyntämisen suoraan liiketoiminnan tarpeisiin. Valitsemme käyttämämme teknologiat aina asiakastarpeen mukaisesti, mutta hyödynnämme ratkaisuissamme erityisesti Azurea.Työssäsi pääset varmistamaan, että asiakkaamme hyödyntävät keräämäänsä dataa mahdollisimman tehokkaasti. Suunnittelet uusia tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, ja työskentelet asiakasprojekteissamme tai pienkehitystehtävissä. Työskentelet keskimäärin kahdessa projektissa kerrallaan ja projektien kesto vaihtelee muutamasta kuukaudesta vuoteen. Rooliasi voidaan muotoilla osaamisesi ja tavoitteidesi mukaisesti: voit huolehtia asiakkaidemme datasta aina tietovarastoinnista raportointiin saakka tai syventyä esimerkiksi tietoarkkitehtuureihin, mastertiedon hallintaan, tietomallinnukseen, tietovarastointiin tai projektinhallintaan. Työviikkoihin kuuluu käytännön kehitystyön lisäksi yhteistyötä ja erilaisia tapaamisia kollegoiden ja asiakkaan kanssa.Työntekopaikkasi on osaavassa porukassa Espoon, Lahden tai Tampereen toimistoillamme, mutta jos olet kokenut osaaja, onnistuu työn tekeminen etänä mistä tahansa Suomessa. Toki välillä voi tulla tilanteita, että koko tiimi tekee töitä myös asiakkaan tiloissa. Löydät aina kokenutta sparrailuseuraa useista eri tiimeistämme ja työskenteletkin noin 150 ammattilaisemme ja eri asiantuntijatiimiemme kanssa Suomessa ja Ruotsissa.

Haluatko olla mukana muovaamassa tulevaisuuden datalähtöisiä pilvipalveluita? Olemme etsimässä Azure Data Architectia, joka ei pelkää hypätä uusimpien teknologioiden pyörteisiin ja haastaviin projekteihin. Tämä rooli vaatii syvällistä osaamista ja ammattitaitoa, mutta tarjoaa samalla mahdollisuuden vaikuttaa merkittävästi siihen, miten yritykset optimoivat dataansa liiketoiminnan kehittämisessä.TehtävästäAzure Data Architect -roolissa pääset rakentamaan tulevaisuuden dataratkaisuja, jotka eivät ole ainoastaan kestäviä, vaan myös innovatiivisia. Sinun tehtävänäsi on soveltaa uusimpia teknologioita yhdessä Cloud1:n kehittämien automaatiokonseptien kanssa, luoden samalla kestäviä ja kehittyviä ratkaisuja. Työskentelet syvällisesti Delta Lakehouse -ratkaisujen parissa hyödyntäen Azuren Synapse-pipelineja, Databricksin Unity Catalogia sekä älykkäitä tietovarastoratkaisuja. Tämän avulla mahdollistat datan monipuolisen hyödyntämisen analytiikassa, asiakasrajapinnoilla ja AI-malleissa. Myös Power Platformin työvälineet kuuluvat työkalupakkiisi, eikä analytiikka ole sinulle vain sivutuote. Et näe delta-tauluja ja *Spark-teknologiaa pelkästään koodiriveinä, vaan ymmärrät niiden voiman integraatioissa ja datan analysoinnissa. Liiketoiminnan päätöksenteko vaatii muutakin, kuin teknologiaa, joten arkkitehdin rooliin kuuluu kiinteästi myös analytiikka ja tiedonhallinta.Azure ei ole sinulle vain pilvipalvelu, vaan se on ammattitaitosi alusta. Olet vastuussa luomaan ja hallitsemaan data-arkkitehtuureja, jotka mahdollistavat datan sulavan liikkumisen ja tarjoavat voimakkaan pohjan päätöksenteolle. Työskentelet tiiviisti asiakkaiden ja kumppaneiden kanssa, tarjoten heille näkemyksiä siitä, miten Azuren teknologiat ja parhaat käytännöt voivat kääntää dataa strategiseksi kilpailueduksi.Työtä ei kuitenkaan tarvitse tehdä yksin, vaan olet osa Cloud1-tiimiä, joka on täynnä kokeneita ammattilaisia ja lupaavia kykyjä. Rakennatte yhdessä älykkäitä ratkaisuja, jotka ovat sekä teknisesti kehittyneitä että liiketoiminnallisesti kriittisiä. Cloud1 ei ole vain työpaikka, se on ammatillinen yhteisö, joka tukee sinua ammatillisesti ja tarjoaa innostavan ympäristön oppia uutta ja saavuttaa yhdessä asetetut tavoitteet.TarjoammeTarjoamme ammattilaisille sopivan kokonaispaketin, johon sisältyvät taloudellisten etujen lisäksi mahdollisuus osallistua yrityksemme menestykseen osakkaana. Panostamme myös terveyteesi ja hyvinvointiisi kattavien työterveyspalveluiden ja vakuutusten kautta. Sinulle tarjotaan vapaus valita työvälineesi ja mahdollisuus nauttia monista henkilökohtaisista eduista. Cloud1:n yhteishenki näkyy vuosittaisessa etätyömatkassa ja erilaisissa yhteisissä tapahtumissa.Tervetuloa mukaan rakentamaan tulevaisuuden dataratkaisuja ammattimaisessa ja innostavassa ympäristössä!Kiinnostuitko?

Odotukset ylittävää datavetoista liiketoimintaaHaluatko päästä osaksi mielenkiintoista tarinaamme, jossa pääset työskentelemään paremman datan ja luotettavamman huomisen puolesta?Epical on pohjoismainen datakonsultointiyritys, jonka tavoitteena on luoda maailma, johon me kaikki voimme luottaa. Meidän missiomme on määritellä uudelleen, mitä datakonsultointi voi olla ja mitä sen avulla on mahdollista saavuttaa. Oikeissa käsissä datan voima voi muuttaa elämän paremmaksi. Luottamus on tekemisemme ydin. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että datakonsultteina näemme roolimme ulottuvan neuvonnan ja palvelujen ulkopuolelle. Koska tiedämme, että digitaalisen luottamuksen, datan ja analytiikan, sovellusten ja integraatioiden asiantuntijuus on muutakin kuin teknistä tietämystä. Se on vastuu ja mahdollisuus auttaa ohjaamaan, muokkaamaan ja tekemään maailmasta oikeudenmukaisempaa meille kaikille. Mitä tulet tekemään?Data & Analytics -liiketoiminnallamme on pitkä kokemus analyyttisista sovelluksista, joissa suurten tietomassojen käsittely ja hallinta ovat arkipäivää. Suunnittelemme ja toteutamme asiakkaillemme tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, jotka palvelevat ja mahdollistavat monipuolisen tiedon hyödyntämisen suoraan liiketoiminnan tarpeisiin. Valitsemme käyttämämme teknologiat aina asiakastarpeen mukaisesti, mutta hyödynnämme ratkaisuissamme erityisesti Azurea.Työssäsi pääset varmistamaan, että asiakkaamme hyödyntävät keräämäänsä dataa mahdollisimman tehokkaasti. Suunnittelet uusia tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, ja työskentelet asiakasprojekteissamme tai pienkehitystehtävissä. Työskentelet keskimäärin kahdessa projektissa kerrallaan ja projektien kesto vaihtelee muutamasta kuukaudesta vuoteen. Rooliasi voidaan muotoilla osaamisesi ja tavoitteidesi mukaisesti: voit huolehtia asiakkaidemme datasta aina tietovarastoinnista raportointiin saakka tai syventyä esimerkiksi tietoarkkitehtuureihin, mastertiedon hallintaan, tietomallinnukseen, tietovarastointiin tai projektinhallintaan. Työviikkoihin kuuluu käytännön kehitystyön lisäksi yhteistyötä ja erilaisia tapaamisia kollegoiden ja asiakkaan kanssa.Työntekopaikkasi on osaavassa porukassa Espoon, Lahden tai Tampereen toimistoillamme, mutta jos olet kokenut osaaja, onnistuu työn tekeminen etänä mistä tahansa Suomessa. Toki välillä voi tulla tilanteita, että koko tiimi tekee töitä myös asiakkaan tiloissa. Löydät aina kokenutta sparrailuseuraa useista eri tiimeistämme ja työskenteletkin noin 150 ammattilaisemme ja eri asiantuntijatiimiemme kanssa Suomessa ja Ruotsissa. Saat työkavereiksesi alan rautaisia ammattilaisia, joilla on laajaa kokemusta eri teknologioista sekä palvelujen ja ratkaisujen kehittämisestä asiakkaille. Ketä etsimme?

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader, Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: You wonder what Wolt Market is? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform. Wolt Market delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.Our humble expectationsAbout the role and our humble expectations:It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.Next StepsOur offering to you Lots of room to build the direction of analytics at Wolt. Our Product and Operations organizations will be growing too, meaning that you have the chance to build the team around you and shape the way the organization works with data and analytics.

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: Finance and Fintech is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.About The Role And Our Humble ExpectationsI. It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.II. What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.III. Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.IV. What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.V. Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.Next StepsOur offering to you Lots of room to build the direction of analytics at Wolt. Our Product and Operations organizations will be growing too, meaning that you have the chance to build the team around you and shape the way the organization works with data and analytics. You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You have the chance to decide the ways of working - a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the locations above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup. In addition to our country-specific benefits, our compensation package includes a monthly salary based on your expertise and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie. 🚀You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?
