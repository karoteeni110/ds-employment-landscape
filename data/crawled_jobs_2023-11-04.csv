Meidän missiomme on määritellä uudelleen, mitä datakonsultointi voi olla ja mitä sen avulla on mahdollista saavuttaa. Oikeissa käsissä datan voima voi muuttaa elämän paremmaksi. Luottamus on tekemisemme ydin. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että datakonsultteina näemme roolimme ulottuvan neuvonnan ja palvelujen ulkopuolelle. Koska tiedämme, että digitaalisen luottamuksen, datan ja analytiikan, sovellusten ja integraatioiden asiantuntijuus on muutakin kuin teknistä tietämystä. Se on vastuu ja mahdollisuus auttaa ohjaamaan, muokkaamaan ja tekemään maailmasta oikeudenmukaisempaa meille kaikille.Mitä tulet tekemään?Data & Analytics -liiketoiminnallamme on pitkä kokemus analyyttisista sovelluksista, joissa suurten tietomassojen käsittely ja hallinta ovat arkipäivää.

Who are we?We are a Finnish-based international New Space company with employees from more than 57 countries in Finland, the US, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, and Poland. Our team is a tight-knit group of experts from areas including engineering, software development, and radar technology. We're innovative, driven people who strive for excellence in everything we do. Being advocates of our corporate culture, we value teamwork and curiosity, and we know how to have fun!What do we do?ICEYE is building and operating its commercial constellation of small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with SAR data available to customers. Our satellites acquire images of Earth at any time - even when it's cloudy or dark - providing commercial and government partners with unmatched persistent monitoring capabilities. Information derived from our SAR images helps customers make data-driven decisions to address time-critical challenges in various sectors, such as maritime, disaster management, insurance, and finance.Need for the roleThe ICEYE satellite constellation produces a huge amount of telemetry everyday. Inspection of near real time telemetry is crucial for operating satellites. Long-term telemetry analysis helps to understand the behavior of the spacecraft, debug sudden anomalies and provide feedback to the existing operational procedure as well as the design of new satellites.The work of Spacecraft Engineers and Satellite Operators require easy access to both short term and long term telemetry. Hence, there is a need for processing, storing and exposing the huge amount of telemetry in a meaningful way to our users so that they can focus on their strengths i.e analyzing the behavior of the satellite subsystems or monitoring of the spacecraft's health. With the growing numbers of the satellites, it is also neither possible to monitor all the telemetry parameters for each satellite separately nor carry out similar analysis manually every now and then. This brings the need of automation and creation of an intelligent satellite health monitoring system with necessary alerting features.ResponsibilitiesYou will work as a member of the Telemetry Team focusing primarily on the on-ground handling of the telemetry databases produced on-board. Development of highly scalable and resilient storage, services/data pipelines for both short term and long term telemetry analysis use cases. Build API to expose data to users. Understanding telemetry use cases from the users' perspective is important to build meaningful API for them. Development of a post-processing telemetry warehouse platform to allow meaningful data reduction and visualization.Develop a meaningful satellite configuration management system for ease of fleet handling and automation.Promote the use of meaningful data archiving techniques.Improve the data quality and reliability of the pipeline through proper monitoring and failure handling.Take active part in architecture-related discussions.Drive process discovery and resolution of technical blockers; generate ideas, and identify / solve problems.Produce simple, high quality clean code using frameworks, services, and reusable assets where possible.
Prior experience of working with satellite telemetry is not mandatory, but knowledge of working with large data-oriented software development is crucial for the successful completion of your day to day work. You shall be expected to analyze the data and develop software services for it.RequirementsYour work would include design, development and maintenance of both software and infrastructure solutions for an end to end complex data solution. So, overall this role is a mixture of Data Engineering with an interest towards Data Science knowledge. Work/proven experience in data-oriented software engineering ( 3-5 years)Excellent experience with data processing/analysis libraries (e.g. numpy, pandas, etc) and programming skill (Python)Understanding of Time Series Data Analysis and Visualization TechniquesInterest towards understanding satellite subsystems and generated telemetryGood communication skill to participate in cross departmental projectsComfortable finding his/her own way and living well in the continuous stream of change that is inevitable in a start-up that is beginning to scaleExpertise in non-relational and relational databases, understanding how different data structures can affect the performance
You are expected to work with the environment/tools listed below. Thus, in order to ramp up the work, a certain level of prior knowledge and willingness to learn more is required. Experience in distributed clusters and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)Experience in API development (RESTful API)Basic knowledge of infrastructure as a code (Terraform, Ansible) for resource and service provisioningExperience in cloud based development (AWS)Dedication to code quality, automation and operational excellence: CI/CD pipelines(Github actions), unit/integration testsGeneral understanding of good software development practices
Nice to have: Knowledge of Machine Learning conceptsFamiliarity with GraphQLExperience of working with Time Series DB (InfluxDB is an extra plus!)Experience with building Data WarehouseExperience with Apache Spark, Dask, or any similar data processing frameworkExperience with handling Satellite Data (of any kind)
BenefitsWhat we offer: A job that matters in a dynamic New Space environment with a scale-up approachAn independent role with a supportive and diverse work environmentOccupational healthcare, occupational and private insuranceA yearly benefit budget to spend as you wish (i.e. on sport, transport, wellness, lunch, etc.)Relocation support (i.e. flight tickets, accommodation, relocation buddy program)Time for self-development, research, training, conferences, or certification schemesInspiring and collaborating offices and silent workspaces enabling you to focusRegular internal events for employees (e.g. sports events, team-building events, parties, etc.)A wide variety of best coffee, tea, snacks, and sweets to accompany your daily space mission

DATA ARCHITECTWould you like to be a part of Recordly's story? Now is your chance! We’re looking for a Data Architect eager to help businesses capitalize on the opportunities data offers. Working at Recordly means you get to work with customers that truly want to make data their competitive edge.“WHO/WHAT IS RECORDLY?” YOU MIGHT ASKRecordly is an independent company party of the Futurice family specializing in business data management. Our core business focuses on data management, data architectures, and hands-on data engineering that enable exceptional user experiences, efficiency gains, and new business models. In simple terms, we tech the heck out of data.Our employee promise (besides offering engaging customer assignments of course) includes the possibility to enjoy the company's success and shape who we are and what we do, together. We believe in being open about how the business is going and how the choices we make affect the bottom line. Take a look at our site to get to know us better.NOW TO THE ROLE ITSELFA Data Architect at Recordly typically works in tight cooperation with our customers within different assignments. Assignments vary and may sometimes even require hands-on work from time to time - meaning you may have to open up AWS/Azure/GCP Console and deploy some resources if needed or write some SQL lines when the Data Engineers are not around. As we focus on creating actual business value by creating or utilizing for example data platforms, we value the following skills:  Excellent communication skills both verbal and written, along with the ability to influence and demonstrate confidence in communications with senior-level management. Ability to understand and translate business requirements into data and technical requirements. - And we truly mean this. We want to be the glue, bridge, sellotape - whatever you want to call it - between the IT and business departments so that they understand each other.  Ability to cope with ever-evolving technologies used in the data domain and simultaneously understand the business and engineering side of new data products. - Yes, we know this sounds awful. The data domain is moving 88 miles per hour, making it difficult for anyone to keep up with, for example, what Apache Foundation is releasing next month. Fear not, however, we will help you with this with our continuous learning opportunities and hackathons. Working knowledge of Agile development, including DevOps and DataOps concepts. Finnish and English skills as some of our projects are in Finnish. 
Necessary technical skills:  Experience in designing and building hands-on and running highly available, distributed systems of data extraction, ingestion, and processing of large data sets. - We don’t mind if your experience is also from on-premise systems, as we know that the scalability pains are even higher over there. Experience with data modeling, data warehousing, and building high-volume ETL/ELT pipelines. - If star schemas or Data Vault or Data Warehouse Automation are familiar words to you, you’ll be fine.  Fluent with cloud infrastructure, especially the data side of the big three (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform) - We don’t expect you to be certified (we can help you with that), but work experience at least within one of the big three is needed. Understanding and/or experience with Data Lake infrastructure, Data Warehousing, and Data Analytics tools. - By this we mean, that you know what other tools (MDM, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage tools etc.) are needed for a good data platform and have some experience with those.
 WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOUWhen you join Recordly, you’ll be greeted by our open culture and awesome colleagues. On the more tangible side, we both want you to be able to pay your bills and take good care of yourself. We do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach.

Meidän missiomme on määritellä uudelleen, mitä datakonsultointi voi olla ja mitä sen avulla on mahdollista saavuttaa. Oikeissa käsissä datan voima voi muuttaa elämän paremmaksi. Luottamus on tekemisemme ydin. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että datakonsultteina näemme roolimme ulottuvan neuvonnan ja palvelujen ulkopuolelle. Koska tiedämme, että digitaalisen luottamuksen, datan ja analytiikan, sovellusten ja integraatioiden asiantuntijuus on muutakin kuin teknistä tietämystä. Se on vastuu ja mahdollisuus auttaa ohjaamaan, muokkaamaan ja tekemään maailmasta oikeudenmukaisempaa meille kaikille. Mitä tulet tekemään?Data & Analytics -liiketoiminnallamme on pitkä kokemus analyyttisista sovelluksista, joissa suurten tietomassojen käsittely ja hallinta ovat arkipäivää. Suunnittelemme ja toteutamme asiakkaillemme tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, jotka palvelevat ja mahdollistavat monipuolisen tiedon hyödyntämisen suoraan liiketoiminnan tarpeisiin.

Haluatko olla mukana muovaamassa tulevaisuuden datalähtöisiä pilvipalveluita? Olemme etsimässä Azure Data Architectia, joka ei pelkää hypätä uusimpien teknologioiden pyörteisiin ja haastaviin projekteihin. Tämä rooli vaatii syvällistä osaamista ja ammattitaitoa, mutta tarjoaa samalla mahdollisuuden vaikuttaa merkittävästi siihen, miten yritykset optimoivat dataansa liiketoiminnan kehittämisessä.TehtävästäAzure Data Architect -roolissa pääset rakentamaan tulevaisuuden dataratkaisuja, jotka eivät ole ainoastaan kestäviä, vaan myös innovatiivisia. Sinun tehtävänäsi on soveltaa uusimpia teknologioita yhdessä Cloud1:n kehittämien automaatiokonseptien kanssa, luoden samalla kestäviä ja kehittyviä ratkaisuja. Työskentelet syvällisesti Delta Lakehouse -ratkaisujen parissa hyödyntäen Azuren Synapse-pipelineja, Databricksin Unity Catalogia sekä älykkäitä tietovarastoratkaisuja. Tämän avulla mahdollistat datan monipuolisen hyödyntämisen analytiikassa, asiakasrajapinnoilla ja AI-malleissa. Myös Power Platformin työvälineet kuuluvat työkalupakkiisi, eikä analytiikka ole sinulle vain sivutuote. Et näe delta-tauluja ja *Spark-teknologiaa pelkästään koodiriveinä, vaan ymmärrät niiden voiman integraatioissa ja datan analysoinnissa. Liiketoiminnan päätöksenteko vaatii muutakin, kuin teknologiaa, joten arkkitehdin rooliin kuuluu kiinteästi myös analytiikka ja tiedonhallinta.Azure ei ole sinulle vain pilvipalvelu, vaan se on ammattitaitosi alusta. Olet vastuussa luomaan ja hallitsemaan data-arkkitehtuureja, jotka mahdollistavat datan sulavan liikkumisen ja tarjoavat voimakkaan pohjan päätöksenteolle. Työskentelet tiiviisti asiakkaiden ja kumppaneiden kanssa, tarjoten heille näkemyksiä siitä, miten Azuren teknologiat ja parhaat käytännöt voivat kääntää dataa strategiseksi kilpailueduksi.Työtä ei kuitenkaan tarvitse tehdä yksin, vaan olet osa Cloud1-tiimiä, joka on täynnä kokeneita ammattilaisia ja lupaavia kykyjä. Rakennatte yhdessä älykkäitä ratkaisuja, jotka ovat sekä teknisesti kehittyneitä että liiketoiminnallisesti kriittisiä. Cloud1 ei ole vain työpaikka, se on ammatillinen yhteisö, joka tukee sinua ammatillisesti ja tarjoaa innostavan ympäristön oppia uutta ja saavuttaa yhdessä asetetut tavoitteet.TarjoammeTarjoamme ammattilaisille sopivan kokonaispaketin, johon sisältyvät taloudellisten etujen lisäksi mahdollisuus osallistua yrityksemme menestykseen osakkaana. Panostamme myös terveyteesi ja hyvinvointiisi kattavien työterveyspalveluiden ja vakuutusten kautta. Sinulle tarjotaan vapaus valita työvälineesi ja mahdollisuus nauttia monista henkilökohtaisista eduista. Cloud1:n yhteishenki näkyy vuosittaisessa etätyömatkassa ja erilaisissa yhteisissä tapahtumissa.Tervetuloa mukaan rakentamaan tulevaisuuden dataratkaisuja ammattimaisessa ja innostavassa ympäristössä!Kiinnostuitko?

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader, Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: You wonder what Wolt Market is? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform. Wolt Market delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.Our humble expectationsAbout the role and our humble expectations:It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights.

In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed.

"Analytics Lead, Finance & Fintech domain","Analytical Skills, Analytics, and Data ScienceBusiness Analytics, Communication, Data Visualization, Leadership, Presentation Skills, Presentations, and Reporting & Analysis",Remote,Full-time,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3743126651,Wolt,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wolt-oy/life,"Wolt · Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland  2 weeks ago  · 23 applicants",2 weeks ago,0,"
Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: Finance and Fintech is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.About The Role And Our Humble ExpectationsI. It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.II. What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.III. Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.IV. What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.V. Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.Next StepsOur offering to you Lots of room to build the direction of analytics at Wolt. Our Product and Operations organizations will be growing too, meaning that you have the chance to build the team around you and shape the way the organization works with data and analytics. You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You have the chance to decide the ways of working - a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the locations above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup. In addition to our country-specific benefits, our compensation package includes a monthly salary based on your expertise and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie. 🚀You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.

Would you like to:  Develop software for millions of people together with companies like Oura, Suunto, Kesko and Säästöpankki?Use tech like Python, Node.js, Typescript, Java, Go, Kubernetes and Docker on top of AWS or GCP?Be part of an open-minded and warm community in a company where you can have a say in how things roll?Earn €5000-6,700/month + bonuses and have the possibility to become a shareholder?
Still reading? Keep on going →Before diving deep into the back-end, a few things you should know about Qvik: we are elbow-deep in the consultancy business, but above all in the people business. We create digital solutions for millions of end users every day by doing design, development and consulting with our clients. And not just any clients, but the most desirable ones in the consumer market, such as Oura, Säästöpankki, Terveystalo, and Sanoma, to name just a few.Our international community consists of 110+ designers, developers, and consultants based in Helsinki and Stockholm. We are not a typical top-down corporation but an inclusive work community where every individual can affect how we roll.Now to the back-end: Some years ago, our developers noted that our customers’ back-ends were not as good as they could be, and thus began our journey to the cloud. Today, we have 15+ back-end engineers advising customers on technology choices and tackling the most complex technical challenges in their projects.You will work with infrastructure, microservices and scalable systems to help our clients build payment systems, efficient data pipelines, and cloud adoptions, among other things. The work is done in our customers’ development teams, usually together with other Qvikies. The end products you are working with are something you would be proud to show to your family and friends – products you want to use yourself.We don’t deliver off-the-shelf tricks, but build new solutions from scratch to meet our customers' demands. So you will work more with cutting-edge software and less with the darkest back-end legacy – joy!Who are we looking for?Technically speaking, our back-end engineers are skilled in Python, Node.js, Typescript, Java, Go, Kubernetes and Docker on top of AWS or GCP. We are looking for professionals who have experience (+10 years) of building cool stuff with some of these technologies. Besides experience with modern cloud platforms, we also value the ability to build CI/CD pipelines and automate cloud deployments. But, as a seasoned techie, you already know that amazing code is just one side of the coin. Currently, we are searching for pros who are comfortable working in Finnish alongside English.The people you work with will be from different backgrounds and have different strengths. This means that we cherish a culture of open-mindedness, equality and empathy toward all people. At the moment, we are reinventing our DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) practices on the company level to make Qvik the best place to work for everyone. But there’s always more work to be done, and we hope that you want to be a part of it.Our offerWe want to care more. We are focusing on creating an even more inspiring and safe culture, learning by doing, deepening our professionalism, and building an even stronger community.But perks and promises won’t pay the bills. The salary for this position will be somewhere between €5000–6,700/month + bonuses, depending on your skills and experience. You will also have the possibility to become a Qvik shareholder.Our standard benefits package is also pretty nice: lunch, commuter, culture and sports benefits, and a bike benefit. Obviously, a solid IT budget and the tools of your choice. We also offer occupational health care with extra health insurance, travel and accident insurance, and many company-supported sports and hobby opportunities with other Qvikies.Supporting the Qvikies' health and work-life balance is essential for us. We also offer sick-child care services for smoother sailing over the flu season, as well as personal support for life challenges via the Auntie service. And don't forget the community glue, aka parties – we are pretty good at setting up some jams, too :)In addition, we offer a low-hierarchy culture, flexible working hours, plenty of projects with opportunities for growth, learning, and so much more.OK, what next?If you want to learn more about working at Qvik, get in touch with our Talent Acquisition team: Mariella Merikallio (mariella.merikallio@qvik.fi) or Olivia Danquah (olivia.danquah@qvik.fi).*Please apply through our recruitment system to ensure that all personal information is handled appropriately.

Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!
