Performance is a very important part of our business and we are optimizing it on every possible place, this includes understanding the hardware, the operating system and the different GC algorithms of the JVM in order to ensure stability and maximize throughput.

We‚Äôre looking for someone with experience in JVM performance tuning, together with an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of JVM garbage collection algorithms.

We're looking for a Data Engineer to help us in our mission to spread joy through singing. In this role, you will build the data infrastructure that shapes Singa‚Äôs song catalog and overall product experience!

As Singa is going through a growth phase, rebuilding its analytics infrastructure is paramount. It‚Äôs a complex problem as Singa offers multi-platform products and has multiple revenue sources being processed natively on each platform and through external invoicing systems across several territories.

As the company grows, getting accurate product, sales, and marketing KPIs data becomes increasingly crucial. Hence, the candidate has a big opportunity to provide an outsized impact on the company's future.

If you're interested in leaving your mark on popular culture by utilizing your skills in data engineering, you've found the job for you!











Singing belongs to everyone, not just professionals and pop stars. It's something fundamental to us humans. That's why we invented Singa - a modern streaming service for karaoke accessible by anyone, anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

We're building the future of singing by doing the same for karaoke that Netflix did for movies and Spotify for music ‚Äî updating an entire industry. We are uniquely positioned to become the biggest brand in a global market representing a 15 billion dollar opportunity.



Let‚Äôs face it. Life without karaoke is boring. Luckily, Singa comes to the rescue at home and Singa-powered karaoke venues worldwide.

The Singa karaoke app gives consumers access to a massive library of high-quality karaoke songs on mobile, web browsers, and Smart TVs. You can sing alone, make it a party with friends, or find the nearest Singa-powered karaoke venue and hit the stage.

On the B2B side, Singa helps pubs, bars, and other nightlife venues grow revenues with professional karaoke, background music, and display advertising software. We have a rapidly growing network of over 1,000 venues in Europe and the USA.



In karaoke, everyone can be themselves; the same applies to Singa. It doesn‚Äôt matter how, where, or when you work as long as it gets done. Individual freedom is coupled with equal amounts of responsibility and ownership.

We are all different but united in our ambition to make an impact on pop culture and our shared mission of making the world sing. Not to mention a few karaoke parties here and there, free singing lessons, epic staff trips, and other related shenanigans to keep it all interesting.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

Their expertise positively impacts the environment and business processes around the world; alongside international colleagues, they drive change and develop solutions that become our pioneering end product. From functional programming, machine learning and interesting algorithms, to building big data pipelines, they‚Äôre behind it all.

Description

Are you passionate about data engineering and data architecture? Would you like to build solutions that create actual business value? At Nitor, we help our clients to succeed with data.



As a Senior Data Engineer at Nitor, your aim is to help our customers extract business value from data with a pragmatic approach, focusing on solving their challenges with the right tools. Your responsibilities might include creating data-intensive applications, automating and orchestrating data pipelines, and simplifying complex technical entities into more common-sense solutions.

Communication with the customer is crucial, and training our customer‚Äôs experts to use and maintain the provided solution is also an intriguing part of your job.

Our customer projects are typically challenging yet professionally rewarding. The projects provide an experienced Senior Data Engineer with the possibility to widely utilize and deepen their skill set. The duration of the projects usually ranges between one year and multiple years, depending on your preferences. Our data business unit Nitor Insight, established in 2018, is a tight-knit and startup-like community with an exceptionally high level of data know-how.









A set of benefits that makes a difference

In addition to meaningful projects and customized possibilities for professional development, we offer you a profound set of employee benefits. Nitor is built in a way that it can support your career development, sustainable work pace, and well-being.

Extremely high expertise and pride for our own and our colleagues' work are things we all have in common. We work with the largest enterprises in Finland, helping them succeed in building a better digital world.

Our growth is solid; for example, our turnover grew by 8,2% in 2021. In 2022, Onway's research gave us the best place for customer satisfaction in the IT sector for the tenth time.

About Newtrax

Newtrax believes the future of mining is underground, not only because minerals close to the surface are increasingly rare, but because underground mines have a significantly lower environmental footprint.

To accelerate the transition to a future where 100% of mining is underground, Newtrax eliminates the current digital divide between surface mines and underground mines. To achieve this goal, Newtrax integrates the latest Internet-of-Things and Artificial Intelligence technologies to monitor and provide insights on underground operations, including people, machines and the environment.

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership,‚ÄØenhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.


The Data department oversees all of Agoda‚Äôs data-related requirements. Our ultimate goal is to enable and increase the use of data in the company through creative approaches and the implementation of powerful resources such as operational and analytical databases, queue systems, BI tools, and data science technology. We hire the brightest minds from around the world to take on this challenge and equip them with the knowledge and tools that contribute to their personal growth and success while supporting our company‚Äôs culture of diversity and experimentation. The role the Data team plays at Agoda is critical as business users, product managers, engineers, and many others rely on us to empower their decision making. We are equally dedicated to our customers by improving their search experience with faster results and protecting them from any fraudulent activities. Data is interesting only when you have enough of it, and we have plenty. This is what drives up the challenge as part of the Data department, but also the reward.


We think of Data Science in Agoda differently. For us, a data scientist is a fusion of core production skills with analytic and business skills. We‚Äôve brought top talents from (literally) all over the world who focus relentlessly on building products which utilize ML and AI as their main edge. We know that when you infuse ML and technology, you move from good to great and that is our mission. Our Data Science managers are action driven leaders that can form vivid vision and successfully direct their people to execute it while being strongly rooted in the details and practice.

As a Data Science Manager, you will:

You are a developer of people. You love leading diverse teams of professionals with both qualitative and quantitative backgrounds using data-driven and insights-led approaches to respond quickly in a dynamic, competitive, and fast changing industry.

Tackle complex problems in the online travel and ecommerce space using a range of ML and data analysis methods. Use our huge data repositories to push our business metrics to their bounds, directly and indirectly. Foster a culture that constantly raises the bar for us and others and supports the freedom to explore and innovate.

Can we detect causation between metrics and bookings? How can automatically answer our users‚Äô questions? How do we tune our AB testing platform to ensure we aren‚Äôt optimizing noise? How do we measure experiment success to properly trade off type I and II errors? What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it? How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack. You will be impacting every aspect of the business and it will require various techniques, from diving deep into data with SQL and Big Data tools, all the way to deploying modern machine learning models.

. Work directly with the heads of the business departments and the product management team. Influence them with compelling product ideas based on data insights that can move the dial on our business.





We welcome both local and international applications for this role. Full visa sponsorship and relocation assistance available for eligible candidates.

Job Description

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt‚Äôs consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you‚Äôre interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app ‚Äì we‚Äôre a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry‚Äôs highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt‚Äôs name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we‚Äôre about getting things done. You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team ‚Äì people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates ‚Äì when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait ‚Äì we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

In other words, it really isn‚Äôt just about who we are. It‚Äôs about who our customers are ‚Äì and where they want to be.



We want individuals who can embody our values of ownership, courage, and openness.

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don‚Äôt falter ‚Äì we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We‚Äôre always open to new ideas ‚Äì from wherever and whoever they come.

We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on our cloud operations platform turning the best open source technologies into frustration-free cloud services.

Job Description

Are you excited about building the best possible experience for Wolt‚Äôs customers? Do you enjoy owning customer journeys holistically, and improving our service and optimizing different parameters of our platform to drive engagement, frequency and retention? Are you highly quant driven, while also always knowing qualitatively what our users would value the most? Do you have a consumer mindset, and willingness to build something extraordinary? If so, then we‚Äôd love to chat!



Wolt is a Finnish technology company and we‚Äôre best known for our food delivery platform. Founded in 2014, today we have more than 8,000 employees, 150,000 courier partners and we operate in 300+ cities across 25 countries. We have also expanded our platform beyond food delivery into multiple retail categories and are even running our own grocery stores with our Wolt Market brand. We are one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. During summer 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash to build a truly global consumer brand.

The Consumer Business team spearheads and owns the development of our Consumer Service, together with our Product and Engineering teams, as well as our country teams. We cover areas such as Consumer Engagement (developing our app better for our users), Subscription and Loyalty (Wolt+ and loyalty points) as well as Consumer Pricing & Promotions. Our job is to fuel Wolt‚Äôs growth, drive up user engagement, retention and frequency. We work closely with local operators, general management and product teams to get the job done, but take full ownership of driving our projects to fruition and tangible business impact. The team consists of high-performing consumer business professionals, pricing & subscription experts and data scientists ‚Äì all running high-impact initiatives with vast independence and responsibility.

We‚Äôre looking for a Manager, Consumer Strategy & Operations to join the team at Senior level and or Manager level. You will play a pivotal role in driving frequency and retention within our user base through developing our customer platform further. You will be working side by side with our Product teams as well as country leadership teams in developing smarter and more engaging services, as well as rolling them out globally with maximum efficiency. In practice, this means that you will be the global business owner for various topics within:



You‚Äôd explore how we can seize growth opportunities within our consumer business ‚Äì and then make it happen through leading operational initiatives all the way to the lowest level of detail. In the process, you‚Äôll play a critical role in shaping our overall consumer business strategy. We‚Äôd expect you to be a pragmatic doer who is more than comfortable with data analysis and analytical problem-solving, but to also have a stellar business intuition and an eye for superb customer experience. In addition, you‚Äôll need strong leadership and stakeholder management skills.

This is your opportunity to join one of the most successful growth companies in Europe, disrupt the delivery industry and improve the daily life of millions of people!











If you are creative, like moving fast, and thrive in a dynamic environment where you get to be proactive and figure out what to do (rather than wait to be told) ‚Äì then apply today.

The Research Group of Prof. Anna-Liisa Laine seeks three post doctoral researchers for an ERC funded Advanced Grant project ‚ÄúCoevolutionary consequences of biodiversity change; Co-EvoChange‚Äù. The main aim of the project is to uncover how human-imposed disturbance in plant communities affects the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions both above- and below ground, and how these changes scale up to ecosystem processes.



We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of above-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios. The selected candidate is expected to take part in designing their project and take full responsibility for its‚Äô implementation from data collection to presentation of results in both scientific journals and conferences. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.








We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of below-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. We are also interested in how altered plant-microbe associations translate to soil ecosystem processes such as decomposition, microbial community growth and carbon use efficiency.

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plants communities. We will use a complementary analytical toolbox to identify how sensitive contemporary plant and microbial community structure and species interactions are to past biodiversity changes and environmental change. Relevant analytical approaches may include, but are not restricted to, Joint Species Distribution Model approaches (.g. HMSC; Sallinen et al. 2020), Random Markov Fields models (Norberg et al. 2023), and network analyses. The Ecological Memory framework can be used to quantify how much past plant biodiversity and environmental conditions affect contemporary plant-microbe associations and ecosystem functioning. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.






The salary of the successful candidate will be based on level 5 of the demands level chart for teaching and research personnel in the salary system of Finnish universities. In addition, the appointee will be paid a salary component based on personal performance. The starting salary will be ca 3400-3800 ‚Ç¨/month. eurs/month, depending on the appointee‚Äôs qualifications and experience.

Job Description

We‚Äôre looking for backend engineers for multiple teams inside the Merchant group.

These are cross-functional teams built with different skill sets, and we expect product engineers to collaborate with Data, Design and Product, ensuring we‚Äôre fulfilling our Merchants' needs.

Merchant products make Wolt an integral part of our Merchants' daily lives. We build tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use. Our products are built around self-service, which helps us keep trust at the core of our partner relationships. If that's something that gets you excited, don't hesitate to drop in your application.



All in all, you'd be part of a team that improves the Wolt experience by helping our merchants serve more customers faster while enabling them to focus on things that are the most important. If that's something that gets you excited, don't hesitate to drop in your application.

We handle the whole development process (business logic, testing, database & data streaming, CI/CD, analytics, cloud) ourselves in an autonomous manner. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre not alone: We have support from central teams when we need help.

We use modern tools and technologies. Current stack in use: Kotlin (Spring Boot, Ktor), Python (Flask & FastAPI), TypeScript, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Kafka, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.

We make the decisions as a team and group of teams! We are free to choose the technology stack and tools and make architectural decisions together. No top-down decisions!

Want to see the impact of your work? We provide our merchants with innovative tools and systems to become more and more efficient and successful, and with that our customers would also get a better experience when ordering with Wolt. We simply make it win-win for everyone!

This role can be based in one of our tech hubs inor, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.



Hands-on: We are looking for people who havebuilding high-quality software. This can include working with Apps, APIs and integrations, handling the whole development cycle all the way to production. Having said that, seniority at Wolt is measured by skills, not the number of years on your CV.

Skilled: We want you to be proficient withon the backend. We find expertise in otherlikegenuinely relevant as a starting off point for learning Kotlin.

Communicator & collaborator: We work closely with our teammates and having a good connection with team members is essential. We understand that everyone has their own unique way of communicating with others. We expect you to be yourself, express your opinions, and work together with the rest of the team.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt‚Äôs name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we‚Äôre about getting things done. You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team ‚Äì people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates ‚Äì when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait ‚Äì we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us.

We‚Äôre always open to new ideas ‚Äì from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on our cloud operations platform turning the best open source technologies into frustration-free cloud services.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.

Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.

This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.

Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you‚Äôll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products:



We're on the brink of an exhilarating journey with generative AI, and we want you to be a part of it. If you're eager to pioneer this transformation and play a pivotal role in the AI-driven future of software development, Trilogy is the place for you.



















Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.

There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!



This is a full-time (40 hours per week), long-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover. The compensation level for this role is $200 USD/hour, which equates to $400,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly.

Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt‚Äôs name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we‚Äôre about getting things done. You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team ‚Äì people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates ‚Äì when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait ‚Äì we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!
