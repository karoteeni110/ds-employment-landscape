THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

“Meillä kaikki tyypit ovat piinkovia asiantuntijoita, joilla on usein monta rautaa tulessa, mutta täällä huokuu sellainen hyvä tekemisen meininki ja arvostus toisiamme kohtaan.”

Dagmarissa meitä ajaa ihmisten lisäksi datalähtöinen näkökulma markkinointiin ja olemmekin yksi Suomen suurimmista markkinointitoimistoista. Seuraamme alan muutossuuntia globaalisti ja haluamme olla askeleen edellä siinä, mitä asiakkaamme tulevaisuudessa tarvitsevat.

Asiakkaamme ovat kiittäneet meitä tuloksellisuudesta, eri toimialojen ymmärtämisestä, vahvasta digitaalisuudesta, modernista markkinointiosaamisesta sekä vastuullisuudesta.

Kanssamme pysyt aina ajan tasalla, maan parhaiden asiantuntijoiden seurassa.

Millaista meillä on tehdä töitä?

Pääset osaksi kunnianhimoista, mutta rentoa ammattilaisten työyhteisöä. Olemme kiinnostuneita näkemään asiat toisin ja luomaan rohkeasti uusia polkuja. Meille hakeutuu ihmisiä, jotka arvostavat vahvaa ja kannustavaa yhteishenkeä ja inspiroituvat yhdessä tekemisestä. Sparraamme päivittäin toinen toisiamme, sekä jaamme tietoa ja taitoa koko yhteisön hyväksi. Haastamme tekemistä ja ajattelua hyvässä hengessä.

Meillä on huikea työyhteisö, jossa tekeminen on hauskaa ja työtä tehdään tiiminä. Saat joustavuutta ja vapautta päättää miten työtäsi teet – arvostamme aidosti työntekijöidemme näkemyksellisyyttä ja luovuutta. Tuemme sinua kehityspolkusi määrittämisessä ja työssäsi menestymisessä. Saat tehdä työtä sillä tavoin, miten se sinulle parhaiten sopii - esimerkiksi viihtyisällä toimistollamme Helsingin ydinkeskustassa tai etänä, siellä missä luovuutesi kukkii parhaiten.

Meille on tärkeää olla inhimillinen työnantaja, ja haluamme tukea työntekijöidemme kokonaisvaltaista hyvinvointia tarjoamalla esimerkiksi mahdollisuuden käyttää osan työajastasi itsesi kehittämiseen tai liikuntaan. Lisäksi tarjoamme tietenkin lounasedun, polkupyöräedun, kattavan työterveyden, sekä erilaisia mielen ja kehon hyvinvointiin liittyviä etuja.

Työnkuva

Etsimme tiedolla johtamisen yksikköömme Advanced Analytics -tiimiin vahvistusta tuotteidemme kehittämiseen ja niiden käyttöönottoon asiakkaillemme. Tehtävänäsi on kehittää uusia markkinoinnin mittaamisen palveluita asiakkaillemme, joissa hyödynnetään tekoälyä ja algoritmeja sekä automaattisia dataputkia. Tehtävä edellyttää vahvaa menetelmäosaamista, mutta myös markkinoijien päivittäisten käytännönläheisten ongelmien ymmärtämistä.

Arvostamme kokemusta ja sen tuomaa näkemystä. Toivomme, että olet toiminut kehitys- ja asiakastyön vastuullisessa roolissa jo useamman vuoden ajan. Työskentelytapasi on itsenäinen, toimeen tarttuva ja ripeä, et pelkää vastuuta. Olet utelias ja nöyrä oppimaan jatkuvasti uutta. Siedät kiireisiäkin tilanteita, pystyt johtamaan aikaasi ja osaat pyytää apua, kun sitä tarvitset.









Kiinnostuitko? Hienoa! Lähetä hakemuksesi, palkkatoiveesi ja CV:si viimeistään 5.11.2023. Käsittelemme hakemuksia jo hakuaikana. Haastattelut alkavat marraskuun aikana.

Lisätietoja antaa Ilkka Keskiväli (Director, Advanced Analytics) p. +358 40 861 8967 25.10. klo 10–12 ja 2.11. klo 10–12.

Job Description

Team purpose and mission

Working embedded with Data Scientists and other engineers to develop, deploy, scale and maintain impactful Machine Learning solutions


📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Berlin,, or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.







The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Michal Szafraniec



Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads.

We are looking for Data Engineers!

Solita Connected Data unit in Finland consists of more than 300 data and integration experts. With our growth, we are looking for Data Engineers to work on projects in different industries.



Data Engineers work together with Solita team in various customer projects, where data platforms and various data utilisation solutions are built, data storages are modernised and data obtained from IoT sources is processed.

You have the possibility to influence what kind of project you want to work on. We want to find you a project that includes learning something new, the possibility to use your existing skills, and creating content that is meaningful to you.



At The Core Of The Data Creation Is Data Processing; Loading, Parsing, Saving, Modelling, And Storing. The Tools Are Selected For Each Project As Needed



We expect technological know-how from a Data Engineer, but you don't have to know everything. You get to learn new technologies with us. In addition to tech know-how, we value experience in project work and consulting in the customer interface, but you will learn it by doing. What matters most is your desire to grow your know-how along with the ever-developing IT industry.



We have the muscles of a big company, but the culture of a small company. In practice it means:





Solita is an IT consulting company with Finnish roots, and we also have offices in Europe. Our consultants work with Finnish and international projects.

In addition to Data Engineers, we also have professionals in data science, data visualisation, and master data, as well as a group of experienced data architects. With our work, we aim to create sustainable solutions – ones that we ourselves would like to use and maintain.

Our Values Are Caring, Easy-going, Courage And Passion. Our Employees Have Chosen Those Themselves, And Maybe That's Why We Can See And Feel Value-based Actions Every Day. Here Are a Few Examples





Let's find out together whether we could find the next opportunity in your career with Solita! Our recruitment process includes two interviews, mainly in Teams.

Send us your CV or a link to your LinkedIn profile and we will be in touch with you soon. If you want to tell us more about your wishes for the next career opportunity, you may write an application letter too.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaaja monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme.

Innostutko dataan liittyvistä työtehtävistä ja tahdotko päästä työskentelemään vetovoimaiseen finanssialan yritykseen? Oletko analyyttinen ja pidät ongelmanratkaisusta?

Vahvistamme vähittäispankin dataosaamista Helsingissä nyt Data Engineer Traineella!

Data Engineer Trainee, Vähittäispankki

Traineena tehtävänäsi on avustaa analytiikan osaamiskeskuksen datavarannon ja -prosessien kehittämisessä. Etsit dataa, rakennat dataputkia ja huolehdit datan laadunvarmistuksesta.



Etsimämme trainee on ennen kaikkea kiinnostunut datan ja datatuotteiden kehittämisestä ja hän haluaa kehittää osaamistaan tällä alalla. Hän kykenee analyyttiseen ajatteluun ja pitää tarkkuutta vaativien ongelmien ratkaisemista. Etsimämme henkilö ei tyydy helppoon ratkaisuun vaan pyrkii skaalautuviin ja kestäviin ratkaisuihin, joita on helppo jatkokehittää.

Katsomme tehtävän kannalta eduksi vahvat tietotekniset taidot ml. datatyökalujen ja ohjelmointikielten tuntemuksen (esim. SQL, Python, Spark, Airflow, Databricks, Jenkins). Katsomme eduksi myös tilastollisten menetelmien ja koneoppimismenetelmien tuntemuksen sekä käytännön kokemuksen DataOPS-menetelmin työskentelystä.

Työyhteisössä toimit oma-aloitteisesti, kuitenkin ympärilläsi olevat ihmiset huomioon ottaen. Saatat hyvinkin olla hakemamme osaaja, jos työskentelytapasi on systemaattinen ja ratkaisukeskeinen. Kommunikointi- ja vuorovaikutustaitosi ovat erinomaiset ja verkostoituminen on sinulle luontevaa. Hallitset viestinnän niin suullisesti kuin sähköisissä kanavissa. Sinulla on matemaattistekninen korkeakoulutasoinen koulutus sekä sujuva suomen ja englannin kielen taito.



Pääset mukaan DataOPS-tiimin päivittäiseen työskentelyyn ja auttamaan analyytikoita heidän päivittäisessä työssään datan hyödyntäjinä. Lisäksi pääset kehittämään osaamistasi parinkymmenen analyytikon kanssa, joiden kanssa jaat työkaluja, dataa ja tietoa. Data Engineer -kollegojen kanssa kehität yhteistä datavarantoa ja prosesseja pyrkien varmistamaan, että yksi tieto on yhdessä paikassa.



Tarjoamme Data Engineer -traineelle mahdollisuuden jatkuvaan kehittymiseen yhdessä muiden analytiikan osaamiskeskuksessa työskentelevien Data Engineerien ja analyytikoiden kanssa. Tehtävässä sinulle kehittyy ymmärrystä vähittäispankin liiketoiminnasta sekä monipuolinen tekninen osaaminen modernissa, jatkuvasti kehittyvässä analytiikkaympäristössä.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.

Näin hakuprosessimme etenee





Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa Head of CoE Markku Leskinen puh. 040 8269119 (26.10. klo 15–16 ja 31.10. klo 9–10)

Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet sekä teetetään huumausainetesti.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

RELEX Solutions create cutting-edge optimization software to help retailers and consumer brands drive profitable growth. With growth comes opportunities, and we embrace both.

Our Technology team enjoy a challenge. They're hungry to learn, and don't hesitate to ask what, why, and how. They get to work with our unique, in-house database engine to create high-quality scalable code (just imagine, thousands of stores, millions of products, and billions of rows of raw data!) Their expertise positively impacts the environment and business processes around the world; alongside international colleagues, they drive change and develop solutions that become our pioneering end product.

The complex business logic algorithms and the underlying in-memory database engine (that we’ve built ourselves), that we use to do so, are all implemented using Java and JVM, both crucial technologies at RELEX. The amount of data and the complexity of our algorithms pushes the boundaries of what can be done on a single JVM, at most we use hundreds of cores and heaps of up to 6. Performance is a very important part of our business and we are optimizing it on every possible place, this includes understanding the hardware, the operating system and the different GC algorithms of the JVM in order to ensure stability and maximize throughput.

We’re looking for someone with experience in JVM performance tuning, together with an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of JVM garbage collection algorithms. It would be a great advantage if you brought some experience in distributed systems as well as reading or modifying JVM/JDK source code to better undertand behavior or debug crashes.

Who are we?

We are a Finnish-based international New Space company with employees from more than 57 countries in Finland, the US, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, and Poland. Our team is a tight-knit group of experts from areas including engineering, software development, and radar technology. We're innovative, driven people who strive for excellence in everything we do. Being advocates of our corporate culture, we value teamwork and curiosity, and we know how to have fun!



ICEYE is building and operating its commercial constellation of small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with SAR data available to customers. Our satellites acquire images of Earth at any time - even when it's cloudy or dark - providing commercial and government partners with unmatched persistent monitoring capabilities. Information derived from our SAR images helps customers make data-driven decisions to address time-critical challenges in various sectors, such as maritime, disaster management, insurance, and finance.



The ICEYE satellite constellation produces a huge amount of telemetry everyday. Inspection of near real time telemetry is crucial for operating satellites. Long-term telemetry analysis helps to understand the behavior of the spacecraft, debug sudden anomalies and provide feedback to the existing operational procedure as well as the design of new satellites.

The work of Spacecraft Engineers and Satellite Operators require easy access to both short term and long term telemetry. Hence, there is a need for processing, storing and exposing the huge amount of telemetry in a meaningful way to our users so that they can focus on their strengths i.e analyzing the behavior of the satellite subsystems or monitoring of the spacecraft's health. With the growing numbers of the satellites, it is also neither possible to monitor all the telemetry parameters for each satellite separately nor carry out similar analysis manually every now and then. This brings the need of automation and creation of an intelligent satellite health monitoring system with necessary alerting features.



You will work as a member of the Telemetry Team focusing primarily on the on-ground handling of the telemetry databases produced on-board.

Prior experience of working with satellite telemetry is not mandatory, but knowledge of working with large data-oriented software development is crucial for the successful completion of your day to day work. You shall be expected to analyze the data and develop software services for it.



Your work would include design, development and maintenance of both software and infrastructure solutions for an end to end complex data solution. So, overall this role is a mixture of Data Engineering with an interest towards Data Science knowledge.

You are expected to work with the environment/tools listed below. Thus, in order to ramp up the work, a certain level of prior knowledge and willingness to learn more is required.







Diversity & inclusion are core values at ICEYE. We are passionate about building and sustaining inclusive and equitable working and learning environments for all staff. We believe every member on our team enriches our diversity by exposing us to a broad range of ways to understand and engage with the world, identify challenges, and discover, design, and deliver solutions.

Could this be the role for you? Apply now to start your journey with ICEYE. We are looking forward to receiving your application in English as soon as possible.

We are making the impossible possible together.

Vahvistamme Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan -yksikköämme Helsingissä nyt juristi-traineella!



Harjoittelusi tulee keskittymään data- ja tietosuojajuridiikkaan eli tehtäväsi kytkeytyy EUn tietosuoja-asetuksen ja muun datasääntelyn käytännön soveltamiseen OP Ryhmän toiminnassa. Perehdyt lisäksi myös finanssialaa sekä digitaalista liiketoimintaa koskevaan sääntelyyn. Tulet tukemaan tehtävässä tietosuoja-asiantuntijoidemme sekä tietosuojan asiakaspalvelutiimin arkea sekä toimimaan erilaisissa henkilötietojen käsittelyyn liittyvissä selvittämis- ja ohjaustehtävissä. Kartoitat tietosuojaan liittyviä toimintatapojamme, raportoit niistä sekä koostat kehitysehdotuksia.



Sinulla on oikeustieteellinen korkeakoulututkinto tai olet vastaavien opintojesi loppuvaiheessa. Voit olla myös opintojen alkuvaiheessa, mikäli olet tukenut opintojasi tietosuojaan liittyvällä harjoittelulla. Tietosuojaan, data-asioihin tai digitaalisiin palveluihin liittyvä kokemus katsotaan eduksi. Myös selvityshankkeiden tekeminen ja raportointiosaaminen ovat iso plussa.

Tulet tekemään yhteistyötä monien sidosryhmien kanssa, joten toimit erilaisissa sosiaalisissa tilanteissa luontevasti ja rohkeasti. Työskentelemme pääasiassa suomeksi, mutta alan termistön ymmärtäminen myös englannin kielellä on tärkeää. Näet pienistä osasista koostuvat kokonaisuudet ja kykenet tekemään niin suullisia, kuin kirjallisiakin esityksiä. Työskentelytyylisi on itsenäinen ja olet tarvittaessa valmis tekemään nopeitakin päätöksiä.



Juristi-traineena toimit ryhmän Lakiasiat & Compliance –toiminnon Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan yksikössä, joka palvelee koko OP Ryhmää henkilötietoihin ja dataan liittyvissä oikeudellisissa kysymyksissä. OP Ryhmä tarjoaa yhden Suomen laajimmista tietosuoja- ja data-asioiden toimintakentistä. Toimimme monilla liiketoiminta-alueilla ja digitaalisen kehityksen kärjessä. Tämä on siis aidosti näköalapaikka.



Tehtävässä pääset näkemään, miten iso digitaalinen liiketoiminta vastaa sääntelyvaatimuksiin ja miten muutokset näkyvät kuluttajien arjessa. Tueksesi saat vahvan osaajajoukon, jonka kanssa pääset toiminnan keskiöön harjoittelemaan sääntelyvaatimusten käytännön soveltamista.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa yksikön päällikkö Hanna Lankinen, puh. 040 723 0053 (soittoajat 27.10. klo 12-13 ja 31.10. klo 9-10).

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet sekä teetetään huumausainetesti.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Are you excited about handling petabytes of data and building a world-class data platform? Then let’s talk!

Data that we collect plays a central role in how we make decisions and improve our games to serve our players the best way possible. Our data engineers therefore take great care in keeping the data correct, up to date and easily accessible. In this position you will be responsible for ensuring that our data platform and infrastructure are rock solid and follow modern best practices. You will be actively contributing to various data engineering areas and solving unique challenges arising from the massive scale.

In this role we value a versatile skill set ranging from strong software development background to devops experience to uncompromising attitude towards high data quality. We are aiming to strengthen our team with experts passionate about large scale deployments, real-time data collection and data governance. We also expect you to proactively advance our data tech stack and drive improvement discussions in collaboration with the rest of the team as well as with data engineers and analysts across the company.






Luring you in with glitter, glamour, and gems is not what we seek to do. We develop Supercell as an employer for you to do your best work and to call this the best experience in your professional life.

We want you to enjoy your time here fully, so we structure our compensation and benefits to serve this purpose. It starts with perceiving you as a human being, not a resource.


We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games – played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.


Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you're bringing along.

RELEX Solutions create cutting-edge optimisation software to help retailers and consumer brands drive profitable growth. With growth comes opportunities, and we embrace both. Within our platforms, our teams are driving change, working with international colleagues and the latest tech stack to develop solutions that transform into a pioneering end product; it’s tangible and impactful – for our customers and the world.



Our Technology team enjoy a challenge. They’re hungry to learn, and don’t hesitate to ask what, why, and how. They get to work with various technologies to create high quality scalable applications (just imagine, thousands of stores, millions of products, and billions of rows of raw data!). Their expertise positively impacts the environment and business processes around the world; alongside international colleagues, they drive change and develop solutions that become our pioneering end product. From functional programming, machine learning and interesting algorithms, to building big data pipelines, they’re behind it all. They can work in a flexible way, remote or in-office – after all, they contribute to all our achievements, so we reward them with genuine work-life balance and access to every opportunity.

We are now looking for anto join our Information Security team in Helsinki.



Our customers give us access to some highly confidential business data. As Information Security Expert your job is to continuously develop security compliance at RELEX to prove to our customers that their data is safe with us, and to ensure that we comply with industry best practices for security. You will join our very experienced information security team that is responsible for information and software security. Together with our security owners and product owners you will develop our security controls and work with our external auditors to maintain our ISO 27001 certification and ISAE 3000 SOC 2 Type II attestation. RELEX is a SaaS company with a “Cloud first” approach, so you will have the opportunity to work with modern technologies and SaaS providers.

To succeed in your role, you need to have good communications skills and be good at planning and working across multiple functions. Our team is in the rare position of being able to communicate with and influence any other team, and we are working closely with all departments. At RELEX, our unique approach to security compliance is focused on awareness and cooperation. We want the teams to own their own security controls and to be able to improve security on their own. In audits the evidence is presented by the teams, not by the security team. This is also reflected in our highly collaborative approach in internal audits – or ‘awareness sessions’, as we prefer to call them.



Your job is to maintain and develop our security certifications in close cooperation with our security owners and their teams. As we add new components and services to our offering, you help to ensure that the security controls are implemented consistently and work as expected, and that we have the evidence for this to show our customers. You maintain an open and honest culture around security, helping teams develop their security operations with transparency and auditability in mind. As part of your job, you improve visibility into our security operations, evaluating tooling and services and help deploy them.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader, Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



You wonder whatis? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform.delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.







What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

Job Description

About the Team

The Merchant Analytics Team at Wolt managed by Ayush focuses on solving merchant related challenges and is tasked with unlocking insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations which drive the success of merchants at Wolt.

Data Scientists at Wolt work to uncover insights and turn them into relevant recommendations, driving decisions for the entire organization. On the Merchant team we are focused on ramping up the merchant selection and finding opportunities to help merchants grow their business and be successful on Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects which can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

Our team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and BI Developers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.



As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect marketplace growth, we're looking for someone like you.



















The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme.

Haluaisitko sinä olla osa vaikuttavaa joukkoamme, joka kehittää finanssialan tiedonhallintaa ja parantaa tiedon laatua käytännössä? Vahvistamme nyt Tiedonhallinta-heimoamme Helsingissä kahdella traineella!



Pääasiallisena tehtävänäsi ovat osapuoli- ja asiakasdatan laatupoikkeamien tunnistaminen ja niiden käsittely mm. OP Ryhmän tikettijärjestelmän kautta. Lisäksi työskentelet erilaisten otantojen, analyysien ja muiden tukitehtävien parissa osapuoli- ja asiakastiedon laatuun liittyen.

Tavoitteenasi on ensisijaisesti oppia ymmärtämään mahdollisimman laajasti finanssialan toimintaa sekä sovellus- ja prosessikehittämistä osapuoli- ja asiakastiedon osalta. Tämä avaa mahdollisuuden siirtyä ensimmäiseen varsinaiseen työtehtävääsi. Tiimimme tehtävänä on kehittää OP Ryhmän osapuolimaster-järjestelmää liiketoiminta- ja sääntelyvaatimusten mukaisesti tarjoten hyvälaatuista osapuoli- ja asiakastietoa koko OP Ryhmän käyttöön.







Toivoisitko yhdistäväsi viestinnän osaamisen merkityksellisen työn parissa? Etsimme traineeta viestinnän ja dataregulaation painotuksella.

Pääasiallisena tehtävänäsi on suunnitella ja toteuttaa dataregulaatioalueen viestintää yhteistyössä alueen asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Järjestät sisäisiä tilaisuuksia, tapahtumia ja koulutuksia, joita markkinoit taitavasti. Tehtäviisi kuuluu myös koulutusmateriaalien laatiminen sekä tiimin päivittäisissä tehtävissä tukeminen. Et tule työskentelemään yksin, vaan toimit jatkuvassa vuorovaikutuksessa oman tiimisi jäsenten sekä sidosryhmien kanssa.







Tiedonhallintaheimo on alustaheimo, joka tukee toiminnallaan koko ryhmää. Meillä OP Ryhmässä tieto ei ole vain palvelutuotannon raaka-aine tai sivutuote, vaan se muodostaa yhden tärkeimmistä pääomistamme. Pyrimme jatkuvasti parantamaan tiedon hallintaa ja laatua, ja käytämme sitä mahdollisimman tuottavasti. Olemme asiakasmäärältämme Suomen suurin finanssialan toimija ja käsittelemme jatkuvasti valtavaa määrää dataa.

OPn sisäisissä kyselyissä työntekijämme mainitsevat usein työnsä parhaaksi puoleksi työyhteisön ja huippuosaavat kollegansa, mistä olemme ylpeitä. Meille on tärkeää, että voimme konkreettisesti tukea ja auttaa sinua kehittymään ammatillisesti. Liity rentoon ja aktiiviseen huippujoukkoomme kehittämään tiedon johtamista OPlla!

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja. Lisäksi saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antavat Tiina Mäntykangas p. 044 326 4397 (Communication Specialist Traineen osalta) ja Simo Korhonen p. 040 652 9558 (Data Specialist Traineen osalta). Molemmat tavoitat samoina aikoina ti 24.10. klo 13-14 ja to 26.10 klo 1430-1530.

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet, teetetään huumausainetesti sekä suojelupoliisin teettämä perusmuotoinen turvallisuusselvitys.



OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Job Description

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you’re interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.





What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position you can turn to Group Talent Acquisition Partner / Analytics, Michal Szafraniec at michal.szafraniec@wolt.com

Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.


The Data department oversees all of Agoda’s data-related requirements. Our ultimate goal is to enable and increase the use of data in the company through creative approaches and the implementation of powerful resources such as operational and analytical databases, queue systems, BI tools, and data science technology. We hire the brightest minds from around the world to take on this challenge and equip them with the knowledge and tools that contribute to their personal growth and success while supporting our company’s culture of diversity and experimentation. The role the Data team plays at Agoda is critical as business users, product managers, engineers, and many others rely on us to empower their decision making. We are equally dedicated to our customers by improving their search experience with faster results and protecting them from any fraudulent activities. Data is interesting only when you have enough of it, and we have plenty. This is what drives up the challenge as part of the Data department, but also the reward.


We think of Data Science in Agoda differently. For us, a data scientist is a fusion of core production skills with analytic and business skills. We’ve brought top talents from (literally) all over the world who focus relentlessly on building products which utilize ML and AI as their main edge. We know that when you infuse ML and technology, you move from good to great and that is our mission.

You are a developer of people. You love leading diverse teams of professionals with both qualitative and quantitative backgrounds using data-driven and insights-led approaches to respond quickly in a dynamic, competitive, and fast changing industry.

Tackle complex problems in the online travel and ecommerce space using a range of ML and data analysis methods. Use our huge data repositories to push our business metrics to their bounds, directly and indirectly. Foster a culture that constantly raises the bar for us and others and supports the freedom to explore and innovate.

Can we detect causation between metrics and bookings? How can automatically answer our users’ questions? How do we tune our AB testing platform to ensure we aren’t optimizing noise? How do we measure experiment success to properly trade off type I and II errors? What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it? How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack. You will be impacting every aspect of the business and it will require various techniques, from diving deep into data with SQL and Big Data tools, all the way to deploying modern machine learning models.

. Work directly with the heads of the business departments and the product management team. Influence them with compelling product ideas based on data insights that can move the dial on our business.

We are now looking for experienced Senior Server Engineers to join either the Hay Day or Brawl Stars team. As a Server Engineer at Supercell, you are an integral member of a game team, working closely with other game developers and focusing on making sure that our hundreds of millions of monthly players get the best, most uninterrupted experience possible. Depending on the game and your own interests, you can focus more on the general game server infrastructure or new game feature development – and sometimes you do both.

Communication between server engineers in different game teams is absolutely vital to our success. Our server engineers frequently share learnings, both successes and failures, across game teams to make each team better. You must be humble, pragmatic and willing to admit and explain your mistakes. That way, the next time something goes wrong, we'll all be better prepared.

If you have experience in developing live systems and using virtualized computing, and you understand what it means to support a system with large user volumes, you might just be the person we're looking for!








Luring you in with glitter, glamour, and gems is not what we seek to do. We develop Supercell as an employer for you to do your best work and to call this the best experience in your professional life.

We want you to enjoy your time here fully, so we structure our compensation and benefits to serve this purpose. It starts with perceiving you as a human being, not a resource.


We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games – played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.


Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you're bringing along.

Yrityksen kuvaus

Cubiq Analytics on analytiikkatalo, jossa alan parhaat osaajat haluavat olla töissä. Tehtävämme on toteuttaa suomalaisissa organisaatioissa ennennäkemättömiä läpimurtoja datan avulla.





Onko voima kanssasi? Hyvä! Etsimme tiimiimme jo kokemusta kerryttänyttä Senior Power BI -konsulttia. Oletko sinä etsimämme vahva osaaja?

Tehtävänäsi on kehittää asiakkaillemme pilvipohjaisia analytiikkaratkaisuja Power BI:n avulla. Valomiekkoja emme tällä kertaa tarvitse, mutta Power BI:n tulisi olla hyvin hyppysissäsi. Haemmekin tiimiimme jo kokemusta kerryttänyttä osaajaa, joka hallitsee datan visualisoinnin lisäksi myös sen mallinnuksen. Senior konsulttina olet oman alasi asiantuntija ja jaat osaamistasi mielelläsi niin Cubiqin sisällä kuin asiakastöissäsi: otteesi on sparraava ja tuot aktiivisesti uusia ideoita esiin.

Power BI -tekemisemme kasvaa kohisten, mutta talostamme löytyy jo valmiiksi muita Power BI -osaajia, eikä asioita tarvitse pähkäillä ja pallotella koskaan yksin. Cubiqille tullessasi tuletkin osaksi yhteisöä. Meillä töitä tehdään vahvasti tiimeissä, ja asiakkuuden koosta riippuen tiimissäsi on monesti myös Data Engineerejä ja/tai web-devaajia. Asiakkaamme ovat suuria ja keskisuuria suomalaisia yrityksiä ja julkishallinnon organisaatioita, mikä takaa mielekkäät projektit ja oman osaamisen kehittymisen. Emme ole toimialasidonnaisia, joten asiakkaamme ja toimeksiantomme vaihtelevat laidasta laitaan. Pääsetkin laajentamaan ymmärrystäsi datan ja analytiikan arvoketjun valjastamisesta organisaation tarpeisiin hyvin monipuolisesti.

Rekrytointiprosessin aikana kartoitamme osaamistasi ja intohimoasi analytiikkaa kohtaan, jotta olisimme paras mahdollinen match toisillemme. Meillä ei ole turhaa byrokratiaa, joten rakennamme roolisi ja urapolkusi näiden keskustelujen ja kiinnostuksenkohteidesi pohjalta.












Olemme osa globaalin insinööri-, suunnittelu- ja konsultointiyritys AFRYn Management Consulting -liiketoimintayksikköä. Meillä pääset osaksi energistä ja osallistavaa yhteisöä, jossa on loistava tekemisen meininki ja työtäsi arvostetaan. Saat vaikuttaa aidosti asioihin ja luotsata omia visioitasi eteenpäin. Vapauden ja vastuun lisäksi takaamme joustavan työympäristön sekä kilpailukykyiset edut. Toimistomme sijaitsevat Helsingissä, Lahdessa, Tampereella ja Turussa.

Mitä mieltä töistään ja Cubiqista on meillä Power BI:llä päivittäin ratkaisuja tekevä Senior konsultti Johanna?

“Cubiqilla työskentelyssä parasta on työkaverit sekä vaihtelevat projektit. Monipuolisten työtehtävien ansiosta pääsen kehittämään omaa osaamistani, sillä asiakkaiden tarpeet ja ympäristöt ovat erilaisia. Välillä rakennan talouden Power BI -sovellusta ja seuraavana päivänä kehitän asiakkaan Azure-ympäristöä. Omien taitojen syventyminen onkin takuuvarmaa, ja Cubiqilla on tullut opittua lyhyessä ajassa paljon!”

Jos tulevat työkaverisi ja työkulttuurimme kiinnostavat, voit kurkata meininkiämme nettisivuiltamme https://cubiq.fi tai somekanaviltamme LinkedInistä, Instagramista tai Facebookista nimellä @cubiqanalytics.

Monipuolisten työtehtävien ansiosta pääsen kehittämään omaa osaamistani, sillä asiakkaiden tarpeet ja ympäristöt ovat erilaisia.

Job Description

Role background

Trust and Safety is a new global team at Wolt, focused on proactively mitigating trust and safety risks on the Wolt platform. It is a key priority for us that everyone can feel safe while using Wolt - be it for ordering, delivering or selling goods.

As the Head of Global Trust and Safety, you will have the unique opportunity to drive the development and execution of comprehensive strategies, policies, and initiatives that enhance safety and trust across our entire ecosystem.

Specifically, your work will be focused on reducing trust and safety incidents - to do so you will create policies on how to operate on the platform, you will identify root causes for incidents and form cross-functional teams to solve those, and will drive initiatives to increase the sentiment of safety on the platform.

In this role, you will partner closely with various global functions (including product, operations, legal, analytics, communications, and leadership) to drive forward company-wide projects with high strategic importance.

To succeed in the role, you must be comfortable working at both ends of the spectrum - you’ll be building the high-level strategy and also rolling up your sleeves to get things done!






If you are excited about working in a high-growth environment, taking ownership of things you care about, and being part of an ambitious group of professionals, then click below to apply and get the conversation going!

Along with a competitive salary and benefits, you will also be eligible for our stock option plan.

You will fit into a truly diverse team across 25 countries - what really matters to us is a caring and welcoming environment where we embrace uniqueness and celebrate diversity. Experience a company culture where we work on eye level, decisions are made quickly and knowledge sharing, as well as mentoring, is on our daily agenda.

If you have any further questions about the position, you can turn to:

Enrica Testa, Senior Talent Acqusition Partner at enrica.testa@wolt.com

Please note that we do not accept applications sent by mail. You should submit your application through our careers website!






You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

We work hard to make cities into better places, and it’s pretty cool seeing us grow every week. If you’re passionate about building things that just… work, Wolt might be for you.

We are looking for a Senior Product Manager to join our reporting focused team called Bobby Tables. Our number-crunching service aggregates data from multiple sources within and outside Smartly.io making it one of the most data-heavy parts of the application. Customers can analyze performance of their ad campaigns by using the flexible report builder and data visualizer tool our team has developed.

Besides providing a customer-facing interface to the online analytical processing (OLAP) system that allows it to run complex analysis, the service offers programmatic access to the Reporting engine powering such features as automated actions and automated budget optimizations. The challenges lie in different areas: the scale of the database (several terabytes of data), complexity of database queries powered by flexible query language exposed as REST API, having numerous stakeholders both on client and data ingestion sides. The data structures have been evolving from being focused on one ad serving channel to being abstract cross-channel.

As a Senior Product Manager in this team, you will be leading the vision and execution of enhancing our reporting services to a whole new level. Based on feedback from our customers we want to work on even better visualization, data integrations, and data injections in our reporting services. Your role will involve analyzing these customer needs and developing a strategy to address them.

Open source is our beating heart and it’s something that fuels our work and our culture. It’s where we began. It’s where we’ll always be. Our vision is to become the trusted open source data platform for everyone. We are a Cast of over 400 individuals (‘Crabs’) located across the globe. Why Crabs? Because we believe in thinking sideways. And right now, we’re looking for sideways-thinking engineers.

The Engineering team at Aiven lies at the core of our organization. This is a great opportunity to become an integral member of the team as a Senior Software Engineer (Platform Infrastructure, Networking). We look for engineers who can work around problems by finding new angles. Thinking sideways. You will have the opportunity to collaborate with world-class tech people solving the toughest problems, where almost every project you work on is more complex and technically challenging than the previous one. If you relish pushing your technical boundaries, come join us. Because if you can truly think sideways, you’ll never look back.



So, how do we become the trusted open source data platform for everyone? By listening closely to our customers and taking action to ensure they achieve their business goals. You see, the software we create is merely a means of delivering value. Our thinking is customer-first. That’s why our customers are at the front and center of all we do. And in the spirit of sideways thinking, we’re by their side as well. Actively helping them solve their challenges. Collaborating. Sharing. And innovating. In other words, it really isn’t just about who we are. It’s about who our customers are – and where they want to be.



We want individuals who can embody our values of ownership, courage, and openness.

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don’t falter – we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We’re always open to new ideas – from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on our cloud operations platform turning the best open source technologies into frustration-free cloud services. You’ll be part of a team working on the Aiven cloud platform, improving its scalability and reliability, implementing new features as well as extending our product portfolio of open source data technologies

There are specialization options available in the following areas:



What You'll Do:







Don’t worry if your experience doesn’t line up perfectly – we still encourage you to apply! We believe in investing in our crabs’ professional growth.










Our Offer

If you ask us what’s the best thing about working for Aiven, many will probably say it’s the high concentration of talent from around the world that we have here. Enjoy the agile environment of a hyperscale scale-up where you can truly make an impact and have fun while at it.

We invest in you

Our systems cover all major areas of our business: website, mobile apps, affiliate apis, inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, finance and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD, experimentation and advanced testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like React, Redux state management, Javascript, Kotlin, Scala, data technologies like Kafka, Aerospike and Big Data, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or innovating on the latest fintech idea or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of our Engineering team.


The Senior Engineering Manager role at Agoda is one of the most significant and challenging roles in Technology. The right candidate has both deep technical knowledge and exhibits extremely strong leadership and people development skills. They should also have experience leading large engineering teams and managing managers.

Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.
