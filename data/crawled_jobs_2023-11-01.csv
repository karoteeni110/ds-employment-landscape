Luottamus on tekemisemme ydin. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että datakonsultteina näemme roolimme ulottuvan neuvonnan ja palvelujen ulkopuolelle. Koska tiedämme, että digitaalisen luottamuksen, datan ja analytiikan, sovellusten ja integraatioiden asiantuntijuus on muutakin kuin teknistä tietämystä.

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää.

DATA ARCHITECT,"Data Analytics, Data Warehousing, and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)Business Requirements, Data Extraction, Data Lakes, Data Modeling, Data Vault, Technical Requirements, and Warehouse Automation",Hybrid,,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3747036826,Recordly,https://www.linkedin.com/company/recordlydata/life,"Recordly · Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland  3 weeks ago  · 1 applicant",3 weeks ago,0,"
DATA ARCHITECTWould you like to be a part of Recordly's story? Now is your chance! We’re looking for a Data Architect eager to help businesses capitalize on the opportunities data offers. Working at Recordly means you get to work with customers that truly want to make data their competitive edge.“WHO/WHAT IS RECORDLY?” YOU MIGHT ASKRecordly is an independent company party of the Futurice family specializing in business data management. Our core business focuses on data management, data architectures, and hands-on data engineering that enable exceptional user experiences, efficiency gains, and new business models. In simple terms, we tech the heck out of data.Our employee promise (besides offering engaging customer assignments of course) includes the possibility to enjoy the company's success and shape who we are and what we do, together. We believe in being open about how the business is going and how the choices we make affect the bottom line. Take a look at our site to get to know us better.NOW TO THE ROLE ITSELFA Data Architect at Recordly typically works in tight cooperation with our customers within different assignments. Assignments vary and may sometimes even require hands-on work from time to time - meaning you may have to open up AWS/Azure/GCP Console and deploy some resources if needed or write some SQL lines when the Data Engineers are not around. As we focus on creating actual business value by creating or utilizing for example data platforms, we value the following skills:  Excellent communication skills both verbal and written, along with the ability to influence and demonstrate confidence in communications with senior-level management. Ability to understand and translate business requirements into data and technical requirements. - And we truly mean this. We want to be the glue, bridge, sellotape - whatever you want to call it - between the IT and business departments so that they understand each other.  Ability to cope with ever-evolving technologies used in the data domain and simultaneously understand the business and engineering side of new data products. - Yes, we know this sounds awful. The data domain is moving 88 miles per hour, making it difficult for anyone to keep up with, for example, what Apache Foundation is releasing next month. Fear not, however, we will help you with this with our continuous learning opportunities and hackathons. Working knowledge of Agile development, including DevOps and DataOps concepts. Finnish and English skills as some of our projects are in Finnish. 
Necessary technical skills:  Experience in designing and building hands-on and running highly available, distributed systems of data extraction, ingestion, and processing of large data sets. - We don’t mind if your experience is also from on-premise systems, as we know that the scalability pains are even higher over there. Experience with data modeling, data warehousing, and building high-volume ETL/ELT pipelines. - If star schemas or Data Vault or Data Warehouse Automation are familiar words to you, you’ll be fine.  Fluent with cloud infrastructure, especially the data side of the big three (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform) - We don’t expect you to be certified (we can help you with that), but work experience at least within one of the big three is needed. Understanding and/or experience with Data Lake infrastructure, Data Warehousing, and Data Analytics tools. - By this we mean, that you know what other tools (MDM, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage tools etc.) are needed for a good data platform and have some experience with those.

Haluatko olla mukana muovaamassa tulevaisuuden datalähtöisiä pilvipalveluita? Olemme etsimässä Azure Data Architectia, joka ei pelkää hypätä uusimpien teknologioiden pyörteisiin ja haastaviin projekteihin. Tämä rooli vaatii syvällistä osaamista ja ammattitaitoa, mutta tarjoaa samalla mahdollisuuden vaikuttaa merkittävästi siihen, miten yritykset optimoivat dataansa liiketoiminnan kehittämisessä.TehtävästäAzure Data Architect -roolissa pääset rakentamaan tulevaisuuden dataratkaisuja, jotka eivät ole ainoastaan kestäviä, vaan myös innovatiivisia. Sinun tehtävänäsi on soveltaa uusimpia teknologioita yhdessä Cloud1:n kehittämien automaatiokonseptien kanssa, luoden samalla kestäviä ja kehittyviä ratkaisuja.

Liiketoiminnan päätöksenteko vaatii muutakin, kuin teknologiaa, joten arkkitehdin rooliin kuuluu kiinteästi myös analytiikka ja tiedonhallinta.Azure ei ole sinulle vain pilvipalvelu, vaan se on ammattitaitosi alusta. Olet vastuussa luomaan ja hallitsemaan data-arkkitehtuureja, jotka mahdollistavat datan sulavan liikkumisen ja tarjoavat voimakkaan pohjan päätöksenteolle. Työskentelet tiiviisti asiakkaiden ja kumppaneiden kanssa, tarjoten heille näkemyksiä siitä, miten Azuren teknologiat ja parhaat käytännöt voivat kääntää dataa strategiseksi kilpailueduksi.Työtä ei kuitenkaan tarvitse tehdä yksin, vaan olet osa Cloud1-tiimiä, joka on täynnä kokeneita ammattilaisia ja lupaavia kykyjä. Rakennatte yhdessä älykkäitä ratkaisuja, jotka ovat sekä teknisesti kehittyneitä että liiketoiminnallisesti kriittisiä. Cloud1 ei ole vain työpaikka, se on ammatillinen yhteisö, joka tukee sinua ammatillisesti ja tarjoaa innostavan ympäristön oppia uutta ja saavuttaa yhdessä asetetut tavoitteet.TarjoammeTarjoamme ammattilaisille sopivan kokonaispaketin, johon sisältyvät taloudellisten etujen lisäksi mahdollisuus osallistua yrityksemme menestykseen osakkaana.

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: Finance and Fintech is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.About The Role And Our Humble ExpectationsI. It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.II. What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.III. Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.IV. What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.V. Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.Next StepsOur offering to you Lots of room to build the direction of analytics at Wolt. Our Product and Operations organizations will be growing too, meaning that you have the chance to build the team around you and shape the way the organization works with data and analytics. You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You have the chance to decide the ways of working - a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the locations above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup. In addition to our country-specific benefits, our compensation package includes a monthly salary based on your expertise and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie. 🚀You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.

The NORDIC INVESTMENT BANK (NIB) offers you the chance to do banking that makes a difference. The projects that we finance benefit the environment and improve productivity in the Nordic-Baltic region. We are an International Financial Institution owned by the eight Nordic and Baltic countries, and we offer you the possibility to work with experts from around the world. The challenges you will face working at NIB are unique and will provide you with valuable experiences. We value diversity and we are a close network of some 230 professionals located in the heart of Helsinki. The atmosphere is international and our official working language is English.We are looking for a SENIOR RISK MANAGER - Model Validation Lead to join the Risk Management Office in Helsinki.As financial institutions heavily rely on models, it is imperative for them to understand and manage the risks surrounding the models that drive decision-making. At NIB, the change (in 2020) to a risk-based comprehensive framework for capital and liquidity management further highlighted the need for rigorous management of the risks related to models.Model risk is the potential loss an institution may incur as a consequence of decisions that are principally based on the output of models, due to errors in the development, implementation or use of such models.NIB is recruiting to lead the model validation activities. The key objectives of this function are to 1) help assure decision-makers that key models are reliable, “fit-for-purpose”, perform adequately and comply with internal policies and external expectations, 2) increase stakeholder understanding of model limitations and weaknesses, and 3) contribute to ongoing model improvements.Your role Maintain the model risk management framework (Policy and Guidelines)Maintain the model inventory and manage the model validation programmeDesign and oversee the model performance monitoring and control processRemediate/address findings from the third line of defense (Internal Audit)Assist and educate model owners and users to improve model diligence, including promoting and enforcing sound model development practices and documentation standardsDevelop and manage indicators used to monitor and report on model risksAssist to integrate model risk into operational risk (and non-financial risk) reportingMonitor regulatory developments and best practices for model risk managementIssue recommendations (e.g. mitigating actions) to model owners and users following validation exercises and/or documented observationsContribute thought leadership on model risk and data governance with key stakeholders

We also lead the integration of increasingly important non-financial sources of risk into the risk management mainstream, acting in the second line of defense role when it comes to macro-financial (systemic) risk, business & strategic risk, climate risk (and ESG), and model risk.As a Senior Risk Manager, you would lead the model validation activities. As part of your duties, you would have frequent interaction with model owners, stewards, and users and provide direct input to key decision-making bodies. The role gives frequent opportunities to work with diversified teams of experts from core banking functions such as lending, treasury front and middle office, financial planning, accounting, risk management, and specialists in IT, data, and systems.

The Research Group of Prof. Anna-Liisa Laine seeks three post doctoral researchers for an ERC funded Advanced Grant project “Coevolutionary consequences of biodiversity change; Co-EvoChange”. The main aim of the project is to uncover how human-imposed disturbance in plant communities affects the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions both above- and below ground, and how these changes scale up to ecosystem processes. A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in plant-microbe interactions We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of above-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios. The selected candidate is expected to take part in designing their project and take full responsibility for its’ implementation from data collection to presentation of results in both scientific journals and conferences. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged. Postdoctoral position requirements:   The successful applicant should have a doctoral degree in plant ecology, plant biology, plant pathology, microbial ecology or similar  Previous experience working with questions and methods related to plant microbiome diversity, and the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions  Analytical knowledge: Expertise in analyzing microbial community data – both bioinformatics and statistical inference - is considered an advantage  Excellent written and verbal communication skills  Ability to conceive, execute and complete research projects  Ability to think independently and creatively  Ability to work in a team and independently 
 A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in soil microbial ecology We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of below-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. We are also interested in how altered plant-microbe associations translate to soil ecosystem processes such as decomposition, microbial community growth and carbon use efficiency. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios.

 A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in ecological statistics We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plants communities. We will use a complementary analytical toolbox to identify how sensitive contemporary plant and microbial community structure and species interactions are to past biodiversity changes and environmental change. Relevant analytical approaches may include, but are not restricted to, Joint Species Distribution Model approaches (.g. HMSC; Sallinen et al. 2020), Random Markov Fields models (Norberg et al. 2023), and network analyses. The Ecological Memory framework can be used to quantify how much past plant biodiversity and environmental conditions affect contemporary plant-microbe associations and ecosystem functioning. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.  The successful applicant should have a doctoral degree in statistics, ecology or similar  Previous experience working with questions and methods as described above  Excellent written and verbal communication skills  Ability to conceive, execute and complete research projects  Ability to think independently and creatively  Ability to work in a team and independently
