Solitan Connected Data -yksikkö koostuu Suomessa yli 300:sta data- ja integraatio-osaajasta. Kasvumme myötä haemme lisää Data Engineerejä työskentelemään eri toimialojen projekteihin.



Meillä Data Engineerit työskentelevät yhdessä solitalaisen tiimin kanssa erilaisissa asiakasprojekteissa, joissa rakennetaan muun muassa data platformeja ja erilaisia datan hyödyntämisen ratkaisuja, modernisoidaan tietovarastointia ja jalostetaan IoT-lähteistä saatavaa dataa.

Datatekemisen ytimessä on datan käsittely; lataus, parsinta, tallennus, mallinnus ja varastointi. Työkalut valitaan jokaiseen projektiin tarpeen mukaan:



Data Engineeriltä odotamme teknologiaosaamista ja näyttöjä, mutta kaikkea ei tarvitse hallita. Pääset oppimaan uusia teknologioita kanssamme.

Are you excited about handling petabytes of data and building a world-class data platform? Then let’s talk!

Data that we collect plays a central role in how we make decisions and improve our games to serve our players the best way possible. Our data engineers therefore take great care in keeping the data correct, up to date and easily accessible. In this position you will be responsible for ensuring that our data platform and infrastructure are rock solid and follow modern best practices. You will be actively contributing to various data engineering areas and solving unique challenges arising from the massive scale.

In this role we value a versatile skill set ranging from strong software development background to devops experience to uncompromising attitude towards high data quality. We are aiming to strengthen our team with experts passionate about large scale deployments, real-time data collection and data governance. We also expect you to proactively advance our data tech stack and drive improvement discussions in collaboration with the rest of the team as well as with data engineers and analysts across the company.






Luring you in with glitter, glamour, and gems is not what we seek to do. We develop Supercell as an employer for you to do your best work and to call this the best experience in your professional life.

We want you to enjoy your time here fully, so we structure our compensation and benefits to serve this purpose. It starts with perceiving you as a human being, not a resource.


We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games – played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.


Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you're bringing along.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaaja monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme.

Innostutko dataan liittyvistä työtehtävistä ja tahdotko päästä työskentelemään vetovoimaiseen finanssialan yritykseen? Oletko analyyttinen ja pidät ongelmanratkaisusta?

Vahvistamme vähittäispankin dataosaamista Helsingissä nyt Data Engineer Traineella!

Data Engineer Trainee, Vähittäispankki

Traineena tehtävänäsi on avustaa analytiikan osaamiskeskuksen datavarannon ja -prosessien kehittämisessä. Etsit dataa, rakennat dataputkia ja huolehdit datan laadunvarmistuksesta.



Etsimämme trainee on ennen kaikkea kiinnostunut datan ja datatuotteiden kehittämisestä ja hän haluaa kehittää osaamistaan tällä alalla. Hän kykenee analyyttiseen ajatteluun ja pitää tarkkuutta vaativien ongelmien ratkaisemista. Etsimämme henkilö ei tyydy helppoon ratkaisuun vaan pyrkii skaalautuviin ja kestäviin ratkaisuihin, joita on helppo jatkokehittää.

Katsomme tehtävän kannalta eduksi vahvat tietotekniset taidot ml. datatyökalujen ja ohjelmointikielten tuntemuksen (esim. SQL, Python, Spark, Airflow, Databricks, Jenkins). Katsomme eduksi myös tilastollisten menetelmien ja koneoppimismenetelmien tuntemuksen sekä käytännön kokemuksen DataOPS-menetelmin työskentelystä.

Työyhteisössä toimit oma-aloitteisesti, kuitenkin ympärilläsi olevat ihmiset huomioon ottaen. Saatat hyvinkin olla hakemamme osaaja, jos työskentelytapasi on systemaattinen ja ratkaisukeskeinen. Kommunikointi- ja vuorovaikutustaitosi ovat erinomaiset ja verkostoituminen on sinulle luontevaa. Hallitset viestinnän niin suullisesti kuin sähköisissä kanavissa. Sinulla on matemaattistekninen korkeakoulutasoinen koulutus sekä sujuva suomen ja englannin kielen taito.



Pääset mukaan DataOPS-tiimin päivittäiseen työskentelyyn ja auttamaan analyytikoita heidän päivittäisessä työssään datan hyödyntäjinä. Lisäksi pääset kehittämään osaamistasi parinkymmenen analyytikon kanssa, joiden kanssa jaat työkaluja, dataa ja tietoa. Data Engineer -kollegojen kanssa kehität yhteistä datavarantoa ja prosesseja pyrkien varmistamaan, että yksi tieto on yhdessä paikassa.



Tarjoamme Data Engineer -traineelle mahdollisuuden jatkuvaan kehittymiseen yhdessä muiden analytiikan osaamiskeskuksessa työskentelevien Data Engineerien ja analyytikoiden kanssa. Tehtävässä sinulle kehittyy ymmärrystä vähittäispankin liiketoiminnasta sekä monipuolinen tekninen osaaminen modernissa, jatkuvasti kehittyvässä analytiikkaympäristössä.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.

Näin hakuprosessimme etenee





Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa Head of CoE Markku Leskinen puh. 040 8269119 (26.10. klo 15–16 ja 31.10. klo 9–10)

Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitoratatrainee-ohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme

Oletko finanssijuridiikasta kiinnostunut tulevaisuuden tekijä? Haluatko kehittyä ja verkostoitua monipuolisessa ympäristössä Suomen isoimmalla finanssialan toimijalla?

Vahvistamme Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan -yksikköämme Helsingissä nyt juristi-traineella!



Harjoittelusi tulee keskittymään data- ja tietosuojajuridiikkaan eli tehtäväsi kytkeytyy EUn tietosuoja-asetuksen ja muun datasääntelyn käytännön soveltamiseen OP Ryhmän toiminnassa. Perehdyt lisäksi myös finanssialaa sekä digitaalista liiketoimintaa koskevaan sääntelyyn. Tulet tukemaan tehtävässä tietosuoja-asiantuntijoidemme sekä tietosuojan asiakaspalvelutiimin arkea sekä toimimaan erilaisissa henkilötietojen käsittelyyn liittyvissä selvittämis- ja ohjaustehtävissä. Kartoitat tietosuojaan liittyviä toimintatapojamme, raportoit niistä sekä koostat kehitysehdotuksia.



Sinulla on oikeustieteellinen korkeakoulututkinto tai olet vastaavien opintojesi loppuvaiheessa. Voit olla myös opintojen alkuvaiheessa, mikäli olet tukenut opintojasi tietosuojaan liittyvällä harjoittelulla. Tietosuojaan, data-asioihin tai digitaalisiin palveluihin liittyvä kokemus katsotaan eduksi. Myös selvityshankkeiden tekeminen ja raportointiosaaminen ovat iso plussa.

Tulet tekemään yhteistyötä monien sidosryhmien kanssa, joten toimit erilaisissa sosiaalisissa tilanteissa luontevasti ja rohkeasti. Työskentelemme pääasiassa suomeksi, mutta alan termistön ymmärtäminen myös englannin kielellä on tärkeää. Näet pienistä osasista koostuvat kokonaisuudet ja kykenet tekemään niin suullisia, kuin kirjallisiakin esityksiä. Työskentelytyylisi on itsenäinen ja olet tarvittaessa valmis tekemään nopeitakin päätöksiä.



Juristi-traineena toimit ryhmän Lakiasiat & Compliance –toiminnon Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan yksikössä, joka palvelee koko OP Ryhmää henkilötietoihin ja dataan liittyvissä oikeudellisissa kysymyksissä. OP Ryhmä tarjoaa yhden Suomen laajimmista tietosuoja- ja data-asioiden toimintakentistä. Toimimme monilla liiketoiminta-alueilla ja digitaalisen kehityksen kärjessä. Tämä on siis aidosti näköalapaikka.



Tehtävässä pääset näkemään, miten iso digitaalinen liiketoiminta vastaa sääntelyvaatimuksiin ja miten muutokset näkyvät kuluttajien arjessa. Tueksesi saat vahvan osaajajoukon, jonka kanssa pääset toiminnan keskiöön harjoittelemaan sääntelyvaatimusten käytännön soveltamista.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa yksikön päällikkö Hanna Lankinen, puh. 040 723 0053 (soittoajat 27.10. klo 12-13 ja 31.10. klo 9-10).

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet sekä teetetään huumausainetesti.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Traineena tehtävänäsi on avustaa OPn Henkilöasiakasrahoitus ja asumisen palvelut -heimon liiketoimintaraportoinnin kehittämisessä. Etsit dataa ja tuotat analyyseja ja raportteja, jotka tukevat liiketoiminnan kehitystä ja vaikuttavat liiketoimintapäätöksiin.

Trainee-jakson tavoitteita ja painopisteitä on myös mahdollista räätälöidä aiemman kokemuksesi ja mielenkiinnon kohteidesi mukaisesti.



Etsimämme trainee on ennen kaikkea kiinnostunut datan hyödyntämisestä pankkiliiketoiminnassa ja haluaa kehittää osaamistaan tällä alalla. Hän kykenee analyyttiseen ajatteluun ja pitää numeroiden kanssa työskentelystä. Etsimämme henkilö ei tyydy helppoon ratkaisuun vaan pyrkii ymmärtämään liiketoimintaa ja siihen liittyviä haasteita syvällisesti.

Job Description

Wolt operates across 25 countries, and growing. This would not be possible without a state of the art core platform as the backbone managed by the dedicated SME teams in our Core Group. One such team is the Performance and Observability Team having two sub-tracks as the name implies.

Our team currently has four members, each having a diverse background and perspective. Together we own an observability stack that handles billions of metrics, traces and log entries each month. Our customers are all the engineers at Wolt who use this stack to understand the health of their services / infrastructure at scale.

As of today we have 10+ observability components in our stack with scopes spread across application instrumentation, telemetry data collection, visualization, and alerting across our backend and client facing parts of applications. Our day to day work involves keeping this complex ecosystem up and running without a hitch. In parallel to this, we are working on our next generation Observability platform to re-architect our observability pipelines and bring unified visibility for all types of telemetry data to our engineers. That means, you will have unprecedented opportunities and empowerment across many areas in the observability domain to drive the initiatives that will have great impact.

To accelerate the transition to a future where 100% of mining is underground, Newtrax eliminates the current digital divide between surface mines and underground mines. To achieve this goal, Newtrax integrates the latest Internet-of-Things and Artificial Intelligence technologies to monitor and provide insights on underground operations, including people, machines and the environment.

Reporting into our International Payroll Owner and working closely with internal and external stakeholders, you will ensure our employees across Finland and Estonia are paid correctly and on time including annual pay reviews as well as annual bonus and monthly commission schemes.

Alongside this hugely important task, you will work with your colleagues on high-impact payroll projects; including the migration of payroll onto a new payroll system. And as we grow as a business there’s a likelihood that you will also lead on TUPEE payroll projects and folding acquired businesses into our payroll function.

You will also gain an understanding of other European monthly payroll processes by working closely with your colleagues and providing country specific support as necessary.

Ideally, you will live within a reasonable commute of our Espoo Head Office but there is the option of Hybrid working available for this position.


This function will manage, prepare, document, and disburse payroll checks, payroll taxes, and employee benefit payments for Finland and Estonia. This role works closely with Trimble’s People eXperience (human resources) team to make sure the process goes smoothly. In addition, this role is responsible for creating reports illustrating payroll expenditures, including such items as tax payments and benefit plan disbursements. Some additional day-to-day activities are:








We believe in celebrating our differences. That is why our diversity is our strength. To us, that means actively participating in opportunities to be inclusive. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion have guided our current success while also moving our desire to improve. We actively seek to add members to our community who represent our customers and the places we live and work.

We have programs in place to make sure our people are seen, heard, and welcomed and most importantly that they know they belong, no matter who they are or where they are coming from.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader, Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



You wonder whatis? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform.delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.







What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme.

Haluaisitko sinä olla osa vaikuttavaa joukkoamme, joka kehittää finanssialan tiedonhallintaa ja parantaa tiedon laatua käytännössä? Vahvistamme nyt Tiedonhallinta-heimoamme Helsingissä kahdella traineella!



Pääasiallisena tehtävänäsi ovat osapuoli- ja asiakasdatan laatupoikkeamien tunnistaminen ja niiden käsittely mm. OP Ryhmän tikettijärjestelmän kautta. Lisäksi työskentelet erilaisten otantojen, analyysien ja muiden tukitehtävien parissa osapuoli- ja asiakastiedon laatuun liittyen.

Tavoitteenasi on ensisijaisesti oppia ymmärtämään mahdollisimman laajasti finanssialan toimintaa sekä sovellus- ja prosessikehittämistä osapuoli- ja asiakastiedon osalta. Tämä avaa mahdollisuuden siirtyä ensimmäiseen varsinaiseen työtehtävääsi. Tiimimme tehtävänä on kehittää OP Ryhmän osapuolimaster-järjestelmää liiketoiminta- ja sääntelyvaatimusten mukaisesti tarjoten hyvälaatuista osapuoli- ja asiakastietoa koko OP Ryhmän käyttöön.







Toivoisitko yhdistäväsi viestinnän osaamisen merkityksellisen työn parissa? Etsimme traineeta viestinnän ja dataregulaation painotuksella.

Pääasiallisena tehtävänäsi on suunnitella ja toteuttaa dataregulaatioalueen viestintää yhteistyössä alueen asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Järjestät sisäisiä tilaisuuksia, tapahtumia ja koulutuksia, joita markkinoit taitavasti. Tehtäviisi kuuluu myös koulutusmateriaalien laatiminen sekä tiimin päivittäisissä tehtävissä tukeminen. Et tule työskentelemään yksin, vaan toimit jatkuvassa vuorovaikutuksessa oman tiimisi jäsenten sekä sidosryhmien kanssa.







Tiedonhallintaheimo on alustaheimo, joka tukee toiminnallaan koko ryhmää. Meillä OP Ryhmässä tieto ei ole vain palvelutuotannon raaka-aine tai sivutuote, vaan se muodostaa yhden tärkeimmistä pääomistamme. Pyrimme jatkuvasti parantamaan tiedon hallintaa ja laatua, ja käytämme sitä mahdollisimman tuottavasti. Olemme asiakasmäärältämme Suomen suurin finanssialan toimija ja käsittelemme jatkuvasti valtavaa määrää dataa.

OPn sisäisissä kyselyissä työntekijämme mainitsevat usein työnsä parhaaksi puoleksi työyhteisön ja huippuosaavat kollegansa, mistä olemme ylpeitä. Meille on tärkeää, että voimme konkreettisesti tukea ja auttaa sinua kehittymään ammatillisesti. Liity rentoon ja aktiiviseen huippujoukkoomme kehittämään tiedon johtamista OPlla!

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja. Lisäksi saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antavat Tiina Mäntykangas p. 044 326 4397 (Communication Specialist Traineen osalta) ja Simo Korhonen p. 040 652 9558 (Data Specialist Traineen osalta). Molemmat tavoitat samoina aikoina ti 24.10. klo 13-14 ja to 26.10 klo 1430-1530.

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet, teetetään huumausainetesti sekä suojelupoliisin teettämä perusmuotoinen turvallisuusselvitys.



OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Job Description

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you’re interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

We are now looking for experienced Senior Server Engineers to join either the Hay Day or Brawl Stars team. As a Server Engineer at Supercell, you are an integral member of a game team, working closely with other game developers and focusing on making sure that our hundreds of millions of monthly players get the best, most uninterrupted experience possible. Depending on the game and your own interests, you can focus more on the general game server infrastructure or new game feature development – and sometimes you do both.

Communication between server engineers in different game teams is absolutely vital to our success. Our server engineers frequently share learnings, both successes and failures, across game teams to make each team better. You must be humble, pragmatic and willing to admit and explain your mistakes. That way, the next time something goes wrong, we'll all be better prepared.

If you have experience in developing live systems and using virtualized computing, and you understand what it means to support a system with large user volumes, you might just be the person we're looking for!








Luring you in with glitter, glamour, and gems is not what we seek to do. We develop Supercell as an employer for you to do your best work and to call this the best experience in your professional life.

We want you to enjoy your time here fully, so we structure our compensation and benefits to serve this purpose. It starts with perceiving you as a human being, not a resource.


We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games – played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.


Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you're bringing along.

Job Description

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - Pricing and AdTech. This advert is focused on the Pricing domain, but if you’re interested in AdTech, please check this job advert.


The Consumer Pricing Data Science team is committed to consumer-first pricing that's fair, transparent, and compliant. We create innovative pricing solutions that offer clear value for our consumers. We collaborate cross-functionally to achieve both short-term and long-term business goals. Our team of Data Scientists and partners closely with Product, Engineering, Strategy & Operations, conducting experiments, advanced analytics, and operational reporting to enhance our consumer pricing strategies.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect Pricing, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Your technical expertise in MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Kafka, coupled with your leadership skills, will drive the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of our database systems at Wolt.

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Anna Pivovar (anna.pivovar@wolt.com).

Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us.

Job Description

Wolt is looking for a Flutter Engineer to join our Merchant App team, this team owns the Merchant Application - the main Wolt operating tool for the venues. The merchant app team is a cross-functional team consisting of 5 engineers, a designer, a QA automation engineer, a data analyst as well as a product lead, and a team lead. The current challenge for the team is to rethink and rebuild the merchant app - the one used by thousands of venues in 23 countries. The team has mostly new development work with little support of the iOS app. The in-store operations team is also a cross-functional team with 4 engineers, a manual QA, a designer, a data analyst, a product lead, and a team lead.

The team's main focus is retail, the current challenge is to continue to build the application (still mostly new development) and strengthen the basis for both of the teams. We tend to follow the latest development trends in the Flutter community and take action when needed. Our codebase makes use of layered architecture, reactive state management, and the Navigator 2.0 API. The project initially targeted only mobile phones and this year we are focusing on large screens with tablets, so do tell us if you have experience designing responsive user interfaces, this would be a great asset. We use Github Actions as our CI and CD tool. We do common things uncommonly well and ensuring we're keeping the Wolt-grade quality is key in our development.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.



We are looking for a, with a few years of professional experience working on mobile applications, including commercial experience working specifically with Flutter.

We’d love to hear from you if you’re curious, humble, willing to learn and strive when working in collaborative environments that provide a lot of autonomy.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Job Description

We are looking for a Product Lead to join our Consumer Search team. The search team is responsible for enabling Wolt users to find all that they need, easily.

What does it mean in practice? We are on an exciting journey building the best search experience in the industry that delights our customers. Whether they are looking for pasta (whether from their favorite restaurant or from a grocery store nearby), an ethernet cable for the PS5 they just copped, or the trendiest organic shop in their city, we aim to make it easy to find it and to deliver it promptly to their doorstep. We want to make entire cities discoverable via Wolt’s search experience.

As a Product Lead, you will work with a cross-functional team of incredibly talented engineering, design, product and analytics humans in a high visibility role. You will be responsible for defining the roadmap and setting the vision for your team. This involves leading multiple projects and cross-team product initiatives across the entire product lifecycle, partnering with business and operations stakeholders as well as understanding our end-users better than anyone.

Your home base will be Wolt’s product management team but you will be working on a daily basis with the Consumer Search team but also with the business operations and country team, who are responsible for the global and local businesses. When it comes to career progression, this role has a fairly clear path to a more strategy-focused and leadership-oriented role (e.g. head of product) over time, as one delivers impact. We’ll let you in on a little secret: most of Wolt’s product people leads today have been promoted from within 🥳.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in,or, or you can work remotely anywhere in,,,, and. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.



You could come to this role from a multitude of different backgrounds, but ideally, you have





The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Elif Dilan Ayaz (elifdilan.ayaz@wolt.com).



Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

In this role, you will partner closely with various global functions (including product, operations, legal, analytics, communications, and leadership) to drive forward company-wide projects with high strategic importance.

To succeed in the role, you must be comfortable working at both ends of the spectrum - you’ll be building the high-level strategy and also rolling up your sleeves to get things done!

Founded in 2014, today we have more than 8,000 employees, 150,000 courier partners and we operate in 300+ cities across 25 countries. We have also expanded our platform beyond food delivery into multiple retail categories and are even running our own grocery stores with our Wolt Market brand. We are one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. During summer 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash to build a truly global consumer brand.

The Consumer Business team spearheads and owns the development of our Consumer Service, together with our Product and Engineering teams, as well as our country teams. We cover areas such as Consumer Engagement (developing our app better for our users), Subscription and Loyalty (Wolt+ and loyalty points) as well as Consumer Pricing & Promotions. Our job is to fuel Wolt’s growth, drive up user engagement, retention and frequency. We work closely with local operators, general management and product teams to get the job done, but take full ownership of driving our projects to fruition and tangible business impact. The team consists of high-performing consumer business professionals, pricing & subscription experts and data scientists – all running high-impact initiatives with vast independence and responsibility.

We’re looking for a Manager, Consumer Strategy & Operations to join the team at Senior level and or Manager level. You will play a pivotal role in driving frequency and retention within our user base through developing our customer platform further. You will be working side by side with our Product teams as well as country leadership teams in developing smarter and more engaging services, as well as rolling them out globally with maximum efficiency. In practice, this means that you will be the global business owner for various topics within:



You’d explore how we can seize growth opportunities within our consumer business – and then make it happen through leading operational initiatives all the way to the lowest level of detail. In the process, you’ll play a critical role in shaping our overall consumer business strategy. We’d expect you to be a pragmatic doer who is more than comfortable with data analysis and analytical problem-solving, but to also have a stellar business intuition and an eye for superb customer experience. In addition, you’ll need strong leadership and stakeholder management skills.

This is your opportunity to join one of the most successful growth companies in Europe, disrupt the delivery industry and improve the daily life of millions of people!











If you are creative, like moving fast, and thrive in a dynamic environment where you get to be proactive and figure out what to do (rather than wait to be told) – then apply today.

The Research Group of Prof. Anna-Liisa Laine seeks three post doctoral researchers for an ERC funded Advanced Grant project “Coevolutionary consequences of biodiversity change; Co-EvoChange”. The main aim of the project is to uncover how human-imposed disturbance in plant communities affects the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions both above- and below ground, and how these changes scale up to ecosystem processes.



We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of above-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios. The selected candidate is expected to take part in designing their project and take full responsibility for its’ implementation from data collection to presentation of results in both scientific journals and conferences. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plants communities. We will use a complementary analytical toolbox to identify how sensitive contemporary plant and microbial community structure and species interactions are to past biodiversity changes and environmental change. Relevant analytical approaches may include, but are not restricted to, Joint Species Distribution Model approaches (.g. HMSC; Sallinen et al. 2020), Random Markov Fields models (Norberg et al. 2023), and network analyses. The Ecological Memory framework can be used to quantify how much past plant biodiversity and environmental conditions affect contemporary plant-microbe associations and ecosystem functioning. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.






The salary of the successful candidate will be based on level 5 of the demands level chart for teaching and research personnel in the salary system of Finnish universities. In addition, the appointee will be paid a salary component based on personal performance. The starting salary will be ca 3400-3800 €/month. eurs/month, depending on the appointee’s qualifications and experience.

Job Description

Are you interested in being part of building a service that is unique to the tastes of our over 20 million users? Would you like to be in the midst of it all, learning, growing, and expanding into new verticals together with us? Does working with Python and Machine Learning and building things from scratch sound like something you’d like to do? If the answers to all 3 questions are “yes”, then great news since Wolt is looking for a Python Backend Engineer to join our Courier Logistics Estimation Team!

lies in one of the more complex parts of Wolt’s business - the logistics. This is because our logistics platform is responsible for courier task allocation and estimating delivery estimates that our customers, couriers, and merchants see. So, naturally, having a more efficient logistics platform would benefit everyone in our ecosystem: our Courier Partners, our merchants, and our customers. In this role you will be working closely with other backend engineers and data scientists as well as UX designers and frontend engineers who are working on quite a few interesting solutions. For one, right now we’re developing and deploying machine learning models for estimating different parts of the delivery process as well as designing and running experiments to evaluate their performance.

As a backend engineer in this team you will have a big impact on and be a key player in building new estimate, forecast or dynamic pricing services from scratch, figuring out better ways to run Woltwide consumer-facing A/B tests, as well as helping our data scientists integrate their new ML-based models into our Python backend, and, of course, learning new things from your teammates along the way.

So, if you’re an experienced Python engineer with a background in machine learning or similar field (e.g. data science), an interest in tackling scalability challenges, and building some real cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line. Also, you’ll get a chance to work closely together with our brilliant data scientists (seriously, this is a great chance to learn a lot about data science if you have a knack for it)!

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.



👉 You have fluent programing skills using modern Python, have experience setting up backend microservices, and building solid scalable services and well-structured applications using it.

👉 You have experience working with machine learning or similar computational methods

👉 You have experience working with Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration as well as familiarity with database technologies, such as PostgreSQL.

👉 You have an analytical and curious way of thinking and are comfortable working with real-world data and its different nuances

👉 Since the backend has mostly been written in Python (ofc) and Scala, if you have previous experience and willingness to tinker in the backend with Scala - even better, we consider that a plus!

👉 Most importantly, you’re a dedicated person who is pragmatic with a positive attitude, who doesn't shy away from going outside of their comfort zone, and demonstrates curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

💯 Overall our product organization consists of a team of over 700 people at Wolt. We aim to build none other than the best-in-the-world engineering team here.

💙 You’ll get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind, and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.

🙌 Join us for an exciting journey! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Lina Muncyte (name.surname(at)wolt.com).

Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

Job Description

The Cart & Checkout team is looking for a Senior Frontend developer to contribute new features for our awesome consumer-facing wolt.com website.

The team is responsible for the end-to-end user experience from the moment users choose the items they want to order all the way through to get them to confirm the purchase on the app and website. Some of the key focus areas of the team are basket management, cart review, checkout experience and group orders. The team is a cross-functional team of Frontend, Backend, iOS, Android, Data Analyst, Design, a Team lead and a Product Lead. Their mission is to offer Wolt grade order experience on our platform; helping consumers to order in a fast, easy and collaborative way while providing a delightful user experience in different product lines.

In this role, you’ll be working on improving and modifying the very app that millions of people in over 20 countries around the world see when ordering food and other products in Wolt. Our app is top-rated and we place a high value on an awesome end-user experience as well as a cutting-edge UI.

This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. 🌍


We are looking for someone with extensive react and typescript experience, capable of delivering modern, testable and maintainable code. Quality is something we strive for in every aspect of app development from the user interface to having a maintainable architecture and source code, so experience with testing processes is expected. Implementing automated unit & UI testing and collaborating with our excellent QA engineers to prevent regressions will be part of your daily work.

Together we are working not only on new projects, but also improving the user experience for our millions of active users. In addition to the software development skills, we are looking for a team player with great communication and collaboration skills, workload organisation, flexibility and an agile attitude along with a product oriented mindset. We expect you to have these too!


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Severi Kausola (severi.kausola@wolt.com).


Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

The online travel industry is an extremely dynamic and competitive space. We aim to deliver compelling designs that create a world-class customer experience. You will have a key role in defining the future of our products that reach millions of customers. Despite our size, we operate in a startup-like environment.

This is an amazing opportunity if you’re looking for an exciting adventure abroad while expanding your international research capabilities. You get a chance to live in one of the most beautiful and most visited cities in the world!





We’re obsessed with creating compelling experiences for our millions of customers, across our travel booking experiences. We want to make travel easy, and for everyone with an all-in-one shop experience on Agoda.

The Marketing Product Team is trying to bring users, directly or through paid channels, to Agoda, so that over time, when users think of travel, they think of Agoda first. The team is highly data-driven and focused on developing at-scale, measurable, marketing programs & features that improve the lifetime value of Agoda customers. With travel being an infrequently used product, this is far more challenging to do than in a regular e-commerce context. The role of research thus becomes increasingly important, to help us understand how users decide where to book, how we can become their default choice, and so on. Of course, as a highly data-driven company, all insights need to translate into compelling data, as our UX researchers partner with product managers and analysts.







You will own end-to-end planning, execution, analysis, and reporting of research projects, and you will need to consistently achieve research outputs required by the design team and product team for their pursuits and occasionally inform strategic decisions in Product approach or business domain direction:

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.



In Agoda’s Back End Engineering department, we build the scalable, fault-tolerant systems and APIs that host our core business logic. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Aerospike, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of the Back End Engineering team.



The Engineering Manager role at Agoda is one of the most significant and challenging roles at the company. The right candidate is both extremely hands on – technically excellent, with solid engineering principles – and exhibits strong leadership and people development skills. We are looking for world class development managers to lead one or more of our engineering teams.
