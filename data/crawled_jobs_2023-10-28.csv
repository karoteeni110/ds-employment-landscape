Mitä Data Platform Engineer tekee?Data Platform Engineerinä ylläpidät data-alustaa, kehität sen uusia osia ja siihen liittyviä toimintamalleja. Teet aktiivista yhteistyötä alustaa käyttävien tiedolla johtamisen asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Päivittäisessä työssäsi siis omistat ja hallinnoit päivittäisiä matalan tason tuotantoprosesseja, muodostat teknisistä vaatimuksista toteutussuunnitelmia ja implementoit niitä, kehität ja optimoit olemassa olevia ratkaisuja sekä tuotat ja päivität alustan dokumentaatiota.Mitä tarjoamme?Olet osa liiketoiminnan kehitys- ja analytiikkatiimiämme, jossa työskentelee tällä hetkellä hieman yli 10 henkilöä. Tiimimme vastaa konserniyhtiöidemme analytiikasta ja raportoinnista ja se koostuu data- ja ohjelmistoalan asiantuntijoista. Erityisen huolen ammatillisen osaamisesi kehittämisestä pitää tiimimme teknologiajohtajalta. Toteutamme analytiikka- ja raportointiratkaisut end-to-end, joten et jää yksin data-alustan kanssa, sillä työsi tulosten hyödyntäjät istuvat vieressäsi.Data Platform Engineerin tehtävä on toistaiseksi voimassa oleva, ja aloituspäivästä sovitaan yhdessä kanssasi. Päätoimipaikkasi voi sijaita joko Helsingissä tai Oulussa: teemme työtä kuitenkin hyvin joustavasti toimistoillamme sekä etänä, ja voit vaikuttaa oman työntekosi paikkoihin ja rytmiin.

Tervetuloa jatkamaan kanssamme tätä työtä!Mitä toivomme sinulta?Tässä tehtävässä asenne ratkaisee. Toivomme kuitenkin, että sinulla on kokemusta Debian ja Alpine Linux ympäristöistä, tietokantojen ylläpidosta ja kehittämisestä, suurten datamäärien käsittelystä ja prosessoinnista sekä ohjelmointi- ja sovelluskehityskokemusta. Osaaminen tietoverkoista ja suoritettu korkeakoulututkinto (esim. tietotekniikka, tietoliikennetekniikka tai sähkötekniikka) ovat etuja, mutta ennen kaikkea haluat oppia uusista teknologioista ja sinulla on kyky oma-aloitteisesti hakea tietoa niistä.

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader, Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: You wonder what Wolt Market is? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform. Wolt Market delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.Our humble expectationsAbout the role and our humble expectations:It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed.

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: Finance and Fintech is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.About The Role And Our Humble ExpectationsI. It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.II. What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.III. Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.IV. What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.V.

Hei sinä tiedonhallinnan ammattilainen! Etsimme nyt Senior Process Owneria Data Quality Management tiimiimme varmistamaan OP Ryhmän tiedonhallinnan käytäntöjen jatkuvan kehittymisen. Rooli sijaitsee Helsingissä ja voit työskennellä myös joustavasti etänä.Miltä työsi tiedonhallinnan Senior Process Ownerina näyttää?Senior Process Ownerina pääset viemään parhaita tiedonhallinnan käytäntöjä OP Ryhmän päivittäiseen työhön ja liiketoiminnan kehittämiseen. Otat keskeistä roolia tiedon hallintamallin ja tiedon laadunhallinnan kehittämisessä omalla vastuualueellasi. Tehtävässä korostuu proaktiivinen sidosryhmäyhteistyö ja OP-ryhmän merkittävimpien hankkeiden tukeminen. Lisäksi rooliin kuuluu myös tiedonhallinnan sääntelynmukaisuuden varmistaminen yhdessä muiden asiantuntijoiden kanssa.Nämä ovat roolisi suuret linjat; sinulla on tilaisuus olla itse mukana vaikuttamassa siihen, minkälainen toimenkuvastasi muodostuu ja miltä hyvä näyttää tämän päivän tiedon laadunhallinnassa.Edistät siis hyvien dokumentointitapojen kehittämistä, tiedon laatusääntöjen määrittelyä, niiden ottamista käyttöön, tulosten visualisointikyvykkyyksien kehittämistä sekä häiriöhallinnan käytäntöjä.Opastat tiedon omistajia soveltamaan edellä mainittuja kyvykkyyksiä, tekemään juurisyyanalyysejä sekä tunnistamaan, mikä tieto edellyttää ennaltaehkäiseviä tai korjaavia toimenpiteitä esimerkiksi niiden riskipitoisuuden perusteella.Mitä toivomme sinulta & mitä etsimme hakemuksestasi?Tehtävässä menestyminen edellyttää sinulta näkemystä ja kokemusta tiedonhallinnan hankkeista sekä kykyä kyseenalaistaa. Senior Process Ownerin tehtävä sopiikin erinomaisesti esimerkiksi sinulle, joka olet toiminut aikaisemmin data governance -kehityksen parissa, toteuttanut tiedonhallintamallia ja/tai ollut mukana tiedon laadun kehittämisessä. Hyödyksesi on myyvä ja proaktiivinen ote, jotta pystyt tukemaan sidosryhmiäsi parhaalla mahdollisella tavalla. Senior Process Ownerina pääset tuomaan aktiivisesti avaintoimijoita yhteen ja kertomaan sidosryhmille tiedon laadun tärkeydestä.Menestyäksesi tehtävässä, edellytämme sinulta aikaisempaa kokemusta tiedonhallinnasta ja käytäntöjen viemisestä organisaatiosi arkeen. Olet työskennellyt aikaisemmin aiheeseen liittyvien viitekehysten parissa (esimerkiksi DAMA International) ja tiedät miten soveltaa niitä käytäntöön. Osaat myös argumentoida, miksi tiedonhallintamalli ja tiedon laadunhallinta on tärkeää liiketoiminnalle. Sinulle on tuttua ketterillä menetelmillä kehittäminen ja pystyt hyödyntämään ketterää ajattelua työssäsi. Katsomme eduksesi aikaisemman työkokemuksen finanssialalta ja etenkin alaan liittyvän regulaation tuntemuksen.Et missään nimessä tule työskentelemään näiden aiheiden parissa yksin, vaan toimit jatkuvassa vuorovaikutuksessa oman tiimisi jäsenten sekä sidosryhmien kanssa (kuten esimerkiksi IT, liiketoiminta, riskienhallinta ja talous). Pääset arjessasi tekemään läheistä yhteistyötä ja projekteja eri tiimien sekä asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Tämä edellyttää hyviä kommunikointi- ja yhteistyötaitoja suomen ja englannin kielillä.Mitä tarjoamme sinulle?Finanssialan toimijana voisi helposti kuvitella muuta, mutta olemme yksi Suomen suurimpia IT taloja ja tuotamme asiakkaille näkyvät IT-ratkaisut pääosin itsenäisesti alusta loppuun.

Job DescriptionWolt is looking for a Flutter Engineer to join our Merchant App team, this team owns the Merchant Application - the main Wolt operating tool for the venues. The merchant app team is a cross-functional team consisting of 5 engineers, a designer, a QA automation engineer, a data analyst as well as a product lead, and a team lead. The current challenge for the team is to rethink and rebuild the merchant app - the one used by thousands of venues in 23 countries. The team has mostly new development work with little support of the iOS app. The in-store operations team is also a cross-functional team with 4 engineers, a manual QA, a designer, a data analyst, a product lead, and a team lead.The team's main focus is retail, the current challenge is to continue to build the application (still mostly new development) and strengthen the basis for both of the teams. We tend to follow the latest development trends in the Flutter community and take action when needed. Our codebase makes use of layered architecture, reactive state management, and the Navigator 2.0 API. The project initially targeted only mobile phones and this year we are focusing on large screens with tablets, so do tell us if you have experience designing responsive user interfaces, this would be a great asset. We use Github Actions as our CI and CD tool. We do common things uncommonly well and ensuring we're keeping the Wolt-grade quality is key in our development.📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia.

We handle the whole development process (business logic, testing, database & data streaming, CI/CD, analytics, cloud) ourselves in an autonomous manner. Don’t worry, we’re not alone: We have support from central teams when we need help.Technology: We use modern tools and technologies. Current stack in use: Kotlin (Spring Boot, Ktor), Python (Flask & FastAPI), TypeScript, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Kafka, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.Autonomy: We make the decisions as a team and group of teams!

"3 Postdoc positions in Ecology, evolution and statistical analysis of plant-microbe interactions","Bioinformatics, Biology, Ecology, Microbial Ecology, Pathology, Plant Biology, Plant Ecology, Plant Pathology, Soil, and Virus",Full-time,,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3749290834,University of Helsinki,https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-helsinki/life,"University of Helsinki · Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland  2 days ago  · 7 applicants",2 days ago,0,"
The Research Group of Prof. Anna-Liisa Laine seeks three post doctoral researchers for an ERC funded Advanced Grant project “Coevolutionary consequences of biodiversity change; Co-EvoChange”. The main aim of the project is to uncover how human-imposed disturbance in plant communities affects the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions both above- and below ground, and how these changes scale up to ecosystem processes. A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in plant-microbe interactions We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of above-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios. The selected candidate is expected to take part in designing their project and take full responsibility for its’ implementation from data collection to presentation of results in both scientific journals and conferences. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged. Postdoctoral position requirements:   The successful applicant should have a doctoral degree in plant ecology, plant biology, plant pathology, microbial ecology or similar  Previous experience working with questions and methods related to plant microbiome diversity, and the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions  Analytical knowledge: Expertise in analyzing microbial community data – both bioinformatics and statistical inference - is considered an advantage  Excellent written and verbal communication skills  Ability to conceive, execute and complete research projects  Ability to think independently and creatively  Ability to work in a team and independently 
 A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in soil microbial ecology We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of below-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. We are also interested in how altered plant-microbe associations translate to soil ecosystem processes such as decomposition, microbial community growth and carbon use efficiency.

 A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in ecological statistics We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plants communities. We will use a complementary analytical toolbox to identify how sensitive contemporary plant and microbial community structure and species interactions are to past biodiversity changes and environmental change.
