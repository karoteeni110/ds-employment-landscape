RELEX Solutions create cutting-edge optimization software to help retailers and consumer brands drive profitable growth. With growth comes opportunities, and we embrace both. Within our platforms, our teams are driving change, working with international colleagues and the latest tech stack to develop solutions that transform into a pioneering end product; it's tangible and impactful – for our customers and the world.



Our Technology team enjoy a challenge. They're hungry to learn, and don't hesitate to ask what, why, and how. They get to work with our unique, in-house database engine to create high-quality scalable code (just imagine, thousands of stores, millions of products, and billions of rows of raw data!) Their expertise positively impacts the environment and business processes around the world; alongside international colleagues, they drive change and develop solutions that become our pioneering end product.

We are forecasting sales for our customers. The complex business logic algorithms and the underlying in-memory database engine (that we’ve built ourselves), that we use to do so, are all implemented using Java and JVM, both crucial technologies at RELEX. The amount of data and the complexity of our algorithms pushes the boundaries of what can be done on a single JVM, at most we use hundreds of cores and heaps of up to 6. Performance is a very important part of our business and we are optimizing it on every possible place, this includes understanding the hardware, the operating system and the different GC algorithms of the JVM in order to ensure stability and maximize throughput.

We’re looking for someone with experience in JVM performance tuning, together with an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of JVM garbage collection algorithms. It would be a great advantage if you brought some experience in distributed systems as well as reading or modifying JVM/JDK source code to better undertand behavior or debug crashes.

Job Description

Data at Wolt

As the scale of Wolt has rapidly grown, we are introducing new users to our data platform every day and want this to become a coherent and streamlined experience for all users, whether they’re Analysts, Data Scientists working with our data or teams bringing new data to the platform from their applications. We aim to both provide new platform capabilities across batch, streaming, orchestration and data integration to serve our user’s needs, as well as building an intuitive interface for them to solve their use cases without having to learn the details of the underlying tools.

This role is not attached to a specific team, but after you onboard we would determine with you based on our needs and your skillset the best team to start in, whether that is more on the side of the platform, our user-facing tooling to operate the platform or improving our data integration tools.



Our teams have a lot of autonomy and ownership in how they work and solve their challenges. We value collaboration, learning from each other and helping each other out to achieve the team’s goals. We create an environment of trust, in which everyone’s ideas are heard and where we challenge each other to find the best solutions. We have empathy towards our users and other teams. Even though we’re working in a mostly remote environment these days, we stay connected and don’t forget to have fun together building great software!



Our primary programming language of choice is Python. We deploy our systems in Kubernetes and AWS. We use Datadog for observability (logging and metrics). We have built our data warehouse on top of Snowflake and orchestrate our batch processes with Airflow and Dagster. We are heavy users of Kafka and Kafka Connect. Our CI/CD pipelines rely on GitHub actions and Argo Workflows.



The vast majority of our services, applications and data pipelines are written in Python, so several years of having shipped production quality software written in Python is essential. You should be very comfortable with typing, tests and managing dependencies. If you believe that software isn’t just a program running on a machine, but the solution to someone’s problem, you’re in the right place.

Familiarity with parts of our tech stack is definitely a plus, but we hire for attitude and ability to learn over knowing a specific technology that can be learned.

The tools we are building inside of the data platform ultimately serve our many stakeholders across the whole company, whether they are Analysts, Data Scientists or engineers in other teams that produce or consume data. We want all of our users to love the tools we’re building and that is why we want you to focus on building intuitive and user friendly applications that enable everyone to use and work with data at Wolt.



The compensation is a combination of monthly pay and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Fernanda Prado (fernanda.prado.e.silva@wolt.com).



Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

We are currently in the process of transitioning from on-premises systems to a cloud-based platform, and we're offering you the chance to be a part of this transformation and work with cutting-edge technologies.

In your day-to-day work, you will play a crucial role in our ongoing platform transformation, which will support our future business needs. In this renewal, we are transforming our insurance business into a new Guidewire Insurance Suite platform. Thanks to this transformation, in the future we are going to be able to handle insurance, billing & collections and claims all in one platform!

Demonstrating initiative, strong teamwork skills, and a positive attitude are essential attributes we seek.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called “70/20/10 rule” in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great – that’s what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

Our Tech Lead Abhishek Dutta (tel. +358 50 410 4235) will be happy to answer your questions. You can reach Abhishek best on the following dates and times Thursday, November 2nd, from 2 PM to 3 PM and Friday, November 3rd, from 2 PM to 3 PM. Talk to you soon future colleague!

Who are we?

We are a Finnish-based international New Space company with employees from more than 57 countries in Finland, the US, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, and Poland. Our team is a tight-knit group of experts from areas including engineering, software development, and radar technology. We're innovative, driven people who strive for excellence in everything we do. Being advocates of our corporate culture, we value teamwork and curiosity, and we know how to have fun!



ICEYE is building and operating its commercial constellation of small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with SAR data available to customers. Our satellites acquire images of Earth at any time - even when it's cloudy or dark - providing commercial and government partners with unmatched persistent monitoring capabilities. Information derived from our SAR images helps customers make data-driven decisions to address time-critical challenges in various sectors, such as maritime, disaster management, insurance, and finance.



The ICEYE satellite constellation produces a huge amount of telemetry everyday. Inspection of near real time telemetry is crucial for operating satellites. Long-term telemetry analysis helps to understand the behavior of the spacecraft, debug sudden anomalies and provide feedback to the existing operational procedure as well as the design of new satellites.

The work of Spacecraft Engineers and Satellite Operators require easy access to both short term and long term telemetry. Hence, there is a need for processing, storing and exposing the huge amount of telemetry in a meaningful way to our users so that they can focus on their strengths i.e analyzing the behavior of the satellite subsystems or monitoring of the spacecraft's health. With the growing numbers of the satellites, it is also neither possible to monitor all the telemetry parameters for each satellite separately nor carry out similar analysis manually every now and then. This brings the need of automation and creation of an intelligent satellite health monitoring system with necessary alerting features.



You will work as a member of the Telemetry Team focusing primarily on the on-ground handling of the telemetry databases produced on-board.

Prior experience of working with satellite telemetry is not mandatory, but knowledge of working with large data-oriented software development is crucial for the successful completion of your day to day work. You shall be expected to analyze the data and develop software services for it.



Your work would include design, development and maintenance of both software and infrastructure solutions for an end to end complex data solution. So, overall this role is a mixture of Data Engineering with an interest towards Data Science knowledge.

You are expected to work with the environment/tools listed below. Thus, in order to ramp up the work, a certain level of prior knowledge and willingness to learn more is required.







Diversity & inclusion are core values at ICEYE. We are passionate about building and sustaining inclusive and equitable working and learning environments for all staff. We believe every member on our team enriches our diversity by exposing us to a broad range of ways to understand and engage with the world, identify challenges, and discover, design, and deliver solutions.

Could this be the role for you? Apply now to start your journey with ICEYE. We are looking forward to receiving your application in English as soon as possible.

We are making the impossible possible together.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitoratatrainee-ohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme

Oletko finanssijuridiikasta kiinnostunut tulevaisuuden tekijä? Haluatko kehittyä ja verkostoitua monipuolisessa ympäristössä Suomen isoimmalla finanssialan toimijalla?

Vahvistamme Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan -yksikköämme Helsingissä nyt juristi-traineella!



Harjoittelusi tulee keskittymään data- ja tietosuojajuridiikkaan eli tehtäväsi kytkeytyy EUn tietosuoja-asetuksen ja muun datasääntelyn käytännön soveltamiseen OP Ryhmän toiminnassa. Perehdyt lisäksi myös finanssialaa sekä digitaalista liiketoimintaa koskevaan sääntelyyn. Tulet tukemaan tehtävässä tietosuoja-asiantuntijoidemme sekä tietosuojan asiakaspalvelutiimin arkea sekä toimimaan erilaisissa henkilötietojen käsittelyyn liittyvissä selvittämis- ja ohjaustehtävissä. Kartoitat tietosuojaan liittyviä toimintatapojamme, raportoit niistä sekä koostat kehitysehdotuksia.



Sinulla on oikeustieteellinen korkeakoulututkinto tai olet vastaavien opintojesi loppuvaiheessa. Voit olla myös opintojen alkuvaiheessa, mikäli olet tukenut opintojasi tietosuojaan liittyvällä harjoittelulla. Tietosuojaan, data-asioihin tai digitaalisiin palveluihin liittyvä kokemus katsotaan eduksi. Myös selvityshankkeiden tekeminen ja raportointiosaaminen ovat iso plussa.

Tulet tekemään yhteistyötä monien sidosryhmien kanssa, joten toimit erilaisissa sosiaalisissa tilanteissa luontevasti ja rohkeasti. Työskentelemme pääasiassa suomeksi, mutta alan termistön ymmärtäminen myös englannin kielellä on tärkeää. Näet pienistä osasista koostuvat kokonaisuudet ja kykenet tekemään niin suullisia, kuin kirjallisiakin esityksiä. Työskentelytyylisi on itsenäinen ja olet tarvittaessa valmis tekemään nopeitakin päätöksiä.



Juristi-traineena toimit ryhmän Lakiasiat & Compliance –toiminnon Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan yksikössä, joka palvelee koko OP Ryhmää henkilötietoihin ja dataan liittyvissä oikeudellisissa kysymyksissä. OP Ryhmä tarjoaa yhden Suomen laajimmista tietosuoja- ja data-asioiden toimintakentistä. Toimimme monilla liiketoiminta-alueilla ja digitaalisen kehityksen kärjessä. Tämä on siis aidosti näköalapaikka.



Tehtävässä pääset näkemään, miten iso digitaalinen liiketoiminta vastaa sääntelyvaatimuksiin ja miten muutokset näkyvät kuluttajien arjessa. Tueksesi saat vahvan osaajajoukon, jonka kanssa pääset toiminnan keskiöön harjoittelemaan sääntelyvaatimusten käytännön soveltamista.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa yksikön päällikkö Hanna Lankinen, puh. 040 723 0053 (soittoajat 27.10. klo 12-13 ja 31.10. klo 9-10).

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet sekä teetetään huumausainetesti.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme!

Innostutko datasta ja tahdot päästä hyödyntämään tietoteknistä osaamistasi finanssialan työtehtävien parissa? Vahvistamme Kehittäminen ja teknologiat -organisaatiomme Henkilöasiakasrahoitus ja asumisen palvelut -heimoa Data Analyst Traineella Helsingissä!



Traineena tehtävänäsi on avustaa OPn Henkilöasiakasrahoitus ja asumisen palvelut -heimon liiketoimintaraportoinnin kehittämisessä. Etsit dataa ja tuotat analyyseja ja raportteja, jotka tukevat liiketoiminnan kehitystä ja vaikuttavat liiketoimintapäätöksiin.

Trainee-jakson tavoitteita ja painopisteitä on myös mahdollista räätälöidä aiemman kokemuksesi ja mielenkiinnon kohteidesi mukaisesti.



Etsimämme trainee on ennen kaikkea kiinnostunut datan hyödyntämisestä pankkiliiketoiminnassa ja haluaa kehittää osaamistaan tällä alalla. Hän kykenee analyyttiseen ajatteluun ja pitää numeroiden kanssa työskentelystä. Etsimämme henkilö ei tyydy helppoon ratkaisuun vaan pyrkii ymmärtämään liiketoimintaa ja siihen liittyviä haasteita syvällisesti.

Katsomme tehtävän kannalta eduksi vahvat tietotekniset taidot sekä raportointityökalujen ja ohjelmointikielten tuntemuksen. Katsomme eduksi myös tilastollisten menetelmien ja koneoppimismenetelmien tuntemuksen, kirjanpidon ja laskentatoimen tuntemuksen sekä kokemuksen työskentelystä contact centerissa.

Työyhteisössä toimit oma-aloitteisesti, kuitenkin ympärilläsi olevat ihmiset huomioon ottaen. Saatat hyvinkin olla hakemamme osaaja, jos työskentelytapasi on systemaattinen ja ratkaisukeskeinen. Kommunikointi- ja vuorovaikutustaitosi ovat erinomaiset ja verkostoituminen on sinulle luontevaa. Hallitset viestinnän niin suullisesti kuin sähköisissä kanavissa. Sinulla on matemaattistekninen korkeakoulutasoinen koulutus sekä sujuva suomen ja englannin kielen taito.



Meillä pääset tutustumaan siihen, miten ketterää ohjelmistokehitystä tehdään ison finanssialan toimijan monitiimiympäristössä. Harjoittelujakson aikana saat kattavan ymmärryksen modernin ohjelmistotalon työtavasta ja -kulttuurista sekä siitä, miten tiimin tekemiseen on mahdollista vaikuttaa.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa Competence Lead Marko Kiviniemi (puh. +358 40 738 8248) aikoina ke 25.10 klo 14.00-15.00 ja ti 31.10 klo 14.00-15.00.

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet, teetetään huumausainetesti sekä suojelupoliisin perusmuotoinen turvallisuusselvitys.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

RELEX Solutions create cutting-edge optimisation software to help retailers and consumer brands drive profitable growth. With growth comes opportunities, and we embrace both. Within our platforms, our teams are driving change, working with international colleagues and the latest tech stack to develop solutions that transform into a pioneering end product; it’s tangible and impactful – for our customers and the world.



Our Technology team enjoy a challenge. They’re hungry to learn, and don’t hesitate to ask what, why, and how. They get to work with various technologies to create high quality scalable applications (just imagine, thousands of stores, millions of products, and billions of rows of raw data!). Their expertise positively impacts the environment and business processes around the world; alongside international colleagues, they drive change and develop solutions that become our pioneering end product. From functional programming, machine learning and interesting algorithms, to building big data pipelines, they’re behind it all. They can work in a flexible way, remote or in-office – after all, they contribute to all our achievements, so we reward them with genuine work-life balance and access to every opportunity.

We are now looking for anto join our Information Security team in Helsinki.



Our customers give us access to some highly confidential business data. As Information Security Expert your job is to continuously develop security compliance at RELEX to prove to our customers that their data is safe with us, and to ensure that we comply with industry best practices for security. You will join our very experienced information security team that is responsible for information and software security. Together with our security owners and product owners you will develop our security controls and work with our external auditors to maintain our ISO 27001 certification and ISAE 3000 SOC 2 Type II attestation. RELEX is a SaaS company with a “Cloud first” approach, so you will have the opportunity to work with modern technologies and SaaS providers.

To succeed in your role, you need to have good communications skills and be good at planning and working across multiple functions. Our team is in the rare position of being able to communicate with and influence any other team, and we are working closely with all departments. At RELEX, our unique approach to security compliance is focused on awareness and cooperation. We want the teams to own their own security controls and to be able to improve security on their own. In audits the evidence is presented by the teams, not by the security team. This is also reflected in our highly collaborative approach in internal audits – or ‘awareness sessions’, as we prefer to call them.



Your job is to maintain and develop our security certifications in close cooperation with our security owners and their teams. As we add new components and services to our offering, you help to ensure that the security controls are implemented consistently and work as expected, and that we have the evidence for this to show our customers. You maintain an open and honest culture around security, helping teams develop their security operations with transparency and auditability in mind. As part of your job, you improve visibility into our security operations, evaluating tooling and services and help deploy them.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme.

Haluaisitko sinä olla osa vaikuttavaa joukkoamme, joka kehittää finanssialan tiedonhallintaa ja parantaa tiedon laatua käytännössä? Vahvistamme nyt Tiedonhallinta-heimoamme Helsingissä kahdella traineella!



Pääasiallisena tehtävänäsi ovat osapuoli- ja asiakasdatan laatupoikkeamien tunnistaminen ja niiden käsittely mm. OP Ryhmän tikettijärjestelmän kautta. Lisäksi työskentelet erilaisten otantojen, analyysien ja muiden tukitehtävien parissa osapuoli- ja asiakastiedon laatuun liittyen.

Tavoitteenasi on ensisijaisesti oppia ymmärtämään mahdollisimman laajasti finanssialan toimintaa sekä sovellus- ja prosessikehittämistä osapuoli- ja asiakastiedon osalta. Tämä avaa mahdollisuuden siirtyä ensimmäiseen varsinaiseen työtehtävääsi. Tiimimme tehtävänä on kehittää OP Ryhmän osapuolimaster-järjestelmää liiketoiminta- ja sääntelyvaatimusten mukaisesti tarjoten hyvälaatuista osapuoli- ja asiakastietoa koko OP Ryhmän käyttöön.







Toivoisitko yhdistäväsi viestinnän osaamisen merkityksellisen työn parissa? Etsimme traineeta viestinnän ja dataregulaation painotuksella.

Pääasiallisena tehtävänäsi on suunnitella ja toteuttaa dataregulaatioalueen viestintää yhteistyössä alueen asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Järjestät sisäisiä tilaisuuksia, tapahtumia ja koulutuksia, joita markkinoit taitavasti. Tehtäviisi kuuluu myös koulutusmateriaalien laatiminen sekä tiimin päivittäisissä tehtävissä tukeminen. Et tule työskentelemään yksin, vaan toimit jatkuvassa vuorovaikutuksessa oman tiimisi jäsenten sekä sidosryhmien kanssa.







Tiedonhallintaheimo on alustaheimo, joka tukee toiminnallaan koko ryhmää. Meillä OP Ryhmässä tieto ei ole vain palvelutuotannon raaka-aine tai sivutuote, vaan se muodostaa yhden tärkeimmistä pääomistamme. Pyrimme jatkuvasti parantamaan tiedon hallintaa ja laatua, ja käytämme sitä mahdollisimman tuottavasti. Olemme asiakasmäärältämme Suomen suurin finanssialan toimija ja käsittelemme jatkuvasti valtavaa määrää dataa.

OPn sisäisissä kyselyissä työntekijämme mainitsevat usein työnsä parhaaksi puoleksi työyhteisön ja huippuosaavat kollegansa, mistä olemme ylpeitä. Meille on tärkeää, että voimme konkreettisesti tukea ja auttaa sinua kehittymään ammatillisesti. Liity rentoon ja aktiiviseen huippujoukkoomme kehittämään tiedon johtamista OPlla!

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja. Lisäksi saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antavat Tiina Mäntykangas p. 044 326 4397 (Communication Specialist Traineen osalta) ja Simo Korhonen p. 040 652 9558 (Data Specialist Traineen osalta). Molemmat tavoitat samoina aikoina ti 24.10. klo 13-14 ja to 26.10 klo 1430-1530.

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet, teetetään huumausainetesti sekä suojelupoliisin teettämä perusmuotoinen turvallisuusselvitys.



OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.





What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position you can turn to Group Talent Acquisition Partner / Analytics, Michal Szafraniec at michal.szafraniec@wolt.com

Description

Are you interested in improving image quality and have your fingerprint on Amazon Ring camera products? If so, then please do read forward - this could be your dream position.

As an Embedded Software Development Engineer you would be working together with IQ Engineers and relevant stake holders to provide best possible image quality with given hardware.

This work is all about understanding how image is created from sensor to full color image and also related peripherals that help camera to create perfect image for video streaming and also for AI to detect what is in the image.

This work requires coding skills in low level software - both C and C++ - but much more than that it requires capability to innovate solutions that work in a given hardware setup. Therefor it is essential to have camera understanding in this position.

In this position, you will get to see the latest and greatest things in camera industry not yet in the market down to products in shops. Building the architecture for the future and delivering the devices to the market is the key to success in the long run.

At Tampere, we have experts on most areas sitting in the very same office, you can just go and visit them and maybe sketch your idea on paper of white board. The expert network at Amazon Ring is also there to ensure success at your work.

If you feel this is for you, please do apply now.

Key job responsibilities

As an Embedded Software Development Engineer, you need to be able to use all camera hardware capabilities to create the best possible image. This means that you need to be familiar with camera image processing and also how different parts in the image processing pipe interact with each others. The output from your work is code, so low level coding skills with C and C++ are also important.

Typically there is something that can be improved in the image, your task is to figure out how to do it - this requires skills to innovate solutions. A solution can be a small tweak somewhere in the pipeline, refactoring code or creating something totally new; it is essential that what ever you do it is fit for purpose.

If you have other low level skills such as power consumption, memory management, low level data communication, etc. please do mention them in your resume.

Most of the hardware is at the Amazon premises here at Tampere, so you need to be able to work at the Tampere office every day of the week.

A day in the life

New device comes, you need to bring it alive and see that HW is OK, then pass it to IQ engineers. You will need to modify an imaging algorithm based on imaging experts needs and provide a build for the expert to verify that it works as wanted.

As a longer term activity, you are building a prototype to demonstrate low level capabilities of future sensor version.

Around 9 AM and 2 PM people gather in coffee places and at lunch time in local cafeterias. This is good time for refreshing you brain with some non-technical discussion.

We are open to hiring candidates to work out of one of the following locations:

We are now looking for experienced Senior Server Engineers to join either the Hay Day or Brawl Stars team. As a Server Engineer at Supercell, you are an integral member of a game team, working closely with other game developers and focusing on making sure that our hundreds of millions of monthly players get the best, most uninterrupted experience possible. Depending on the game and your own interests, you can focus more on the general game server infrastructure or new game feature development – and sometimes you do both.

Communication between server engineers in different game teams is absolutely vital to our success. Our server engineers frequently share learnings, both successes and failures, across game teams to make each team better. You must be humble, pragmatic and willing to admit and explain your mistakes. That way, the next time something goes wrong, we'll all be better prepared.

If you have experience in developing live systems and using virtualized computing, and you understand what it means to support a system with large user volumes, you might just be the person we're looking for!








Luring you in with glitter, glamour, and gems is not what we seek to do. We develop Supercell as an employer for you to do your best work and to call this the best experience in your professional life.

We want you to enjoy your time here fully, so we structure our compensation and benefits to serve this purpose. It starts with perceiving you as a human being, not a resource.


We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games – played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.

Hei sinä tiedonhallinnan ammattilainen! Etsimme nyt Senior Process Owneria Data Quality Management tiimiimme varmistamaan OP Ryhmän tiedonhallinnan käytäntöjen jatkuvan kehittymisen. Rooli sijaitsee Helsingissä ja voit työskennellä myös joustavasti etänä.

Miltä työsi tiedonhallinnan Senior Process Ownerina näyttää?

Senior Process Ownerina pääset viemään parhaita tiedonhallinnan käytäntöjä OP Ryhmän päivittäiseen työhön ja liiketoiminnan kehittämiseen. Otat keskeistä roolia tiedon hallintamallin ja tiedon laadunhallinnan kehittämisessä omalla vastuualueellasi. Tehtävässä korostuu proaktiivinen sidosryhmäyhteistyö ja OP-ryhmän merkittävimpien hankkeiden tukeminen. Lisäksi rooliin kuuluu myös tiedonhallinnan sääntelynmukaisuuden varmistaminen yhdessä muiden asiantuntijoiden kanssa.

Nämä ovat roolisi suuret linjat; sinulla on tilaisuus olla itse mukana vaikuttamassa siihen, minkälainen toimenkuvastasi muodostuu ja miltä hyvä näyttää tämän päivän tiedon laadunhallinnassa.

Edistät siis hyvien dokumentointitapojen kehittämistä, tiedon laatusääntöjen määrittelyä, niiden ottamista käyttöön, tulosten visualisointikyvykkyyksien kehittämistä sekä häiriöhallinnan käytäntöjä.

Opastat tiedon omistajia soveltamaan edellä mainittuja kyvykkyyksiä, tekemään juurisyyanalyysejä sekä tunnistamaan, mikä tieto edellyttää ennaltaehkäiseviä tai korjaavia toimenpiteitä esimerkiksi niiden riskipitoisuuden perusteella.



Tehtävässä menestyminen edellyttää sinulta näkemystä ja kokemusta tiedonhallinnan hankkeista sekä kykyä kyseenalaistaa. Senior Process Ownerin tehtävä sopiikin erinomaisesti esimerkiksi sinulle, joka olet toiminut aikaisemmin data governance -kehityksen parissa, toteuttanut tiedonhallintamallia ja/tai ollut mukana tiedon laadun kehittämisessä. Hyödyksesi on myyvä ja proaktiivinen ote, jotta pystyt tukemaan sidosryhmiäsi parhaalla mahdollisella tavalla. Senior Process Ownerina pääset tuomaan aktiivisesti avaintoimijoita yhteen ja kertomaan sidosryhmille tiedon laadun tärkeydestä.

Menestyäksesi tehtävässä, edellytämme sinulta aikaisempaa kokemusta tiedonhallinnasta ja käytäntöjen viemisestä organisaatiosi arkeen. Olet työskennellyt aikaisemmin aiheeseen liittyvien viitekehysten parissa (esimerkiksi DAMA International) ja tiedät miten soveltaa niitä käytäntöön. Osaat myös argumentoida, miksi tiedonhallintamalli ja tiedon laadunhallinta on tärkeää liiketoiminnalle. Sinulle on tuttua ketterillä menetelmillä kehittäminen ja pystyt hyödyntämään ketterää ajattelua työssäsi. Katsomme eduksesi aikaisemman työkokemuksen finanssialalta ja etenkin alaan liittyvän regulaation tuntemuksen.

Et missään nimessä tule työskentelemään näiden aiheiden parissa yksin, vaan toimit jatkuvassa vuorovaikutuksessa oman tiimisi jäsenten sekä sidosryhmien kanssa (kuten esimerkiksi IT, liiketoiminta, riskienhallinta ja talous). Pääset arjessasi tekemään läheistä yhteistyötä ja projekteja eri tiimien sekä asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Tämä edellyttää hyviä kommunikointi- ja yhteistyötaitoja suomen ja englannin kielillä.



Finanssialan toimijana voisi helposti kuvitella muuta, mutta olemme yksi Suomen suurimpia IT taloja ja tuotamme asiakkaille näkyvät IT-ratkaisut pääosin itsenäisesti alusta loppuun. Siksi meiltä löytyy tuhansia alan osaajia ja esimerkiksi koodarikulttuuri näyttäytyy jo nykypäivänä vahvana. Voit käydä tutustumassa eri tekemisiimme OPn Tech-puhetta podcastin kautta!

Meillä on käytössämme ns. 70-20-10 -periaate, mikä tarkoittaa, että käytät 70% ajastasi päivittäisiin tehtäviin, 20% työskentelytapojen hiomiseen ja viimeiset 10% vapaasti uusien taitojen oppimiseen. Tämän osuuden voit käyttää esimerkiksi meidän omassa OP Software Academyssa, jossa voit laajentaa osaamistasi monella eri osa-alueella. Kyllä, voit siis laajentaa osaamistasi työajalla!

Elämä on paljon muutakin kuin työtä. Meille on tärkeää, että työ ja vapaa-aika kulkevat rinnakkain ja työnantajana olemme valmiita joustamaan elämän eri tilanteissa. Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat muun muassa henkilöstörahasto sekä henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon, laajan hoitokuluvakuutuksen sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen.



Huippua! Emme malta odottaa, että kuulemme sinusta lisää. Voit hakea tehtävää lähettämällä hakemuksesi, CVsi ja palkkatoiveesi oheisen linkin kauttamennessä.

Kaikkea emme varmasti saa mahdutettua tähän työpaikkailmoitukseen, tästä syystä lisätietoja roolista ja työskentelystä OP Ryhmässä antavat mielellään Tiina Mäntykangas tiina.mantykangas(at)op.fi p.+358443264397 ja Markku Vuorinen markku.vuorinen(a)op.fi +358405540997.



Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet, teetetään huumausainetesti sekä suojelupoliisin teettämä perusmuotoinen turvallisuusselvitys.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Job Description

Role background

Trust and Safety is a new global team at Wolt, focused on proactively mitigating trust and safety risks on the Wolt platform. It is a key priority for us that everyone can feel safe while using Wolt - be it for ordering, delivering or selling goods.

As the Head of Global Trust and Safety, you will have the unique opportunity to drive the development and execution of comprehensive strategies, policies, and initiatives that enhance safety and trust across our entire ecosystem.

Specifically, your work will be focused on reducing trust and safety incidents - to do so you will create policies on how to operate on the platform, you will identify root causes for incidents and form cross-functional teams to solve those, and will drive initiatives to increase the sentiment of safety on the platform.

In this role, you will partner closely with various global functions (including product, operations, legal, analytics, communications, and leadership) to drive forward company-wide projects with high strategic importance.

To succeed in the role, you must be comfortable working at both ends of the spectrum - you’ll be building the high-level strategy and also rolling up your sleeves to get things done!






If you are excited about working in a high-growth environment, taking ownership of things you care about, and being part of an ambitious group of professionals, then click below to apply and get the conversation going!

Along with a competitive salary and benefits, you will also be eligible for our stock option plan.

You will fit into a truly diverse team across 25 countries - what really matters to us is a caring and welcoming environment where we embrace uniqueness and celebrate diversity. Experience a company culture where we work on eye level, decisions are made quickly and knowledge sharing, as well as mentoring, is on our daily agenda.

If you have any further questions about the position, you can turn to:

Enrica Testa, Senior Talent Acqusition Partner at enrica.testa@wolt.com

Please note that we do not accept applications sent by mail. You should submit your application through our careers website!






You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

We work hard to make cities into better places, and it’s pretty cool seeing us grow every week. If you’re passionate about building things that just… work, Wolt might be for you.

Job Description

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you’re interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers.

Job Description

Wolt is looking for a Flutter Engineer to join our Merchant App team, this team owns the Merchant Application - the main Wolt operating tool for the venues. The merchant app team is a cross-functional team consisting of 5 engineers, a designer, a QA automation engineer, a data analyst as well as a product lead, and a team lead. The current challenge for the team is to rethink and rebuild the merchant app - the one used by thousands of venues in 23 countries. The team has mostly new development work with little support of the iOS app. The in-store operations team is also a cross-functional team with 4 engineers, a manual QA, a designer, a data analyst, a product lead, and a team lead.

The team's main focus is retail, the current challenge is to continue to build the application (still mostly new development) and strengthen the basis for both of the teams. We tend to follow the latest development trends in the Flutter community and take action when needed. Our codebase makes use of layered architecture, reactive state management, and the Navigator 2.0 API. The project initially targeted only mobile phones and this year we are focusing on large screens with tablets, so do tell us if you have experience designing responsive user interfaces, this would be a great asset. We use Github Actions as our CI and CD tool. We do common things uncommonly well and ensuring we're keeping the Wolt-grade quality is key in our development.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here.

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Anna Janeta (anna.janeta@wolt.com).



Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff).

Job Description

Are you excited about building the best possible experience for Wolt’s customers? Do you enjoy owning customer journeys holistically, and improving our service and optimizing different parameters of our platform to drive engagement, frequency and retention? Are you highly quant driven, while also always knowing qualitatively what our users would value the most? Do you have a consumer mindset, and willingness to build something extraordinary? If so, then we’d love to chat!



Wolt is a Finnish technology company and we’re best known for our food delivery platform. Founded in 2014, today we have more than 8,000 employees, 150,000 courier partners and we operate in 300+ cities across 25 countries. We have also expanded our platform beyond food delivery into multiple retail categories and are even running our own grocery stores with our Wolt Market brand. We are one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. During summer 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash to build a truly global consumer brand.

The Consumer Business team spearheads and owns the development of our Consumer Service, together with our Product and Engineering teams, as well as our country teams. We cover areas such as Consumer Engagement (developing our app better for our users), Subscription and Loyalty (Wolt+ and loyalty points) as well as Consumer Pricing & Promotions. Our job is to fuel Wolt’s growth, drive up user engagement, retention and frequency. We work closely with local operators, general management and product teams to get the job done, but take full ownership of driving our projects to fruition and tangible business impact. The team consists of high-performing consumer business professionals, pricing & subscription experts and data scientists – all running high-impact initiatives with vast independence and responsibility.

We’re looking for a Manager, Consumer Strategy & Operations to join the team at Senior level and or Manager level. You will play a pivotal role in driving frequency and retention within our user base through developing our customer platform further. You will be working side by side with our Product teams as well as country leadership teams in developing smarter and more engaging services, as well as rolling them out globally with maximum efficiency. In practice, this means that you will be the global business owner for various topics within:



You’d explore how we can seize growth opportunities within our consumer business – and then make it happen through leading operational initiatives all the way to the lowest level of detail. In the process, you’ll play a critical role in shaping our overall consumer business strategy. We’d expect you to be a pragmatic doer who is more than comfortable with data analysis and analytical problem-solving, but to also have a stellar business intuition and an eye for superb customer experience. In addition, you’ll need strong leadership and stakeholder management skills.

This is your opportunity to join one of the most successful growth companies in Europe, disrupt the delivery industry and improve the daily life of millions of people!











If you are creative, like moving fast, and thrive in a dynamic environment where you get to be proactive and figure out what to do (rather than wait to be told) – then apply today.

In other words, it really isn’t just about who we are. It’s about who our customers are – and where they want to be.



We want individuals who can embody our values of ownership, courage, and openness.

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don’t falter – we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We’re always open to new ideas – from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on our cloud operations platform turning the best open source technologies into frustration-free cloud services.

Job Description

We’re looking for backend engineers for multiple teams inside the Merchant group. Our group comprises 10 teams touching Acquisition, Onboarding, Operations, Growth, Retention, and Integrations with our Merchants. These are cross-functional teams built with different skill sets, and we expect product engineers to collaborate with Data, Design and Product, ensuring we’re fulfilling our Merchants' needs.

Merchant products make Wolt an integral part of our Merchants' daily lives. We build tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use. Our products are built around self-service, which helps us keep trust at the core of our partner relationships. If that's something that gets you excited, don't hesitate to drop in your application.



All in all, you'd be part of a team that improves the Wolt experience by helping our merchants serve more customers faster while enabling them to focus on things that are the most important. If that's something that gets you excited, don't hesitate to drop in your application.



Observability and ownership from Kubernetes upwards are very much what we live and breathe. We handle the whole development process (business logic, testing, database & data streaming, CI/CD, analytics, cloud) ourselves in an autonomous manner. Don’t worry, we’re not alone: We have support from central teams when we need help.

We use modern tools and technologies. Current stack in use: Kotlin (Spring Boot, Ktor), Python (Flask & FastAPI), TypeScript, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Kafka, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.

We make the decisions as a team and group of teams! We are free to choose the technology stack and tools and make architectural decisions together. No top-down decisions!

There is a lot of room for learning, teaching and growing together. We will support you with the tools and materials you need.

We’re building lots of new stuff with minimal technical debt, so you can focus on developing new features.

You can choose whether you want to work from home, from the office or hybrid. It’s up to you and we don’t monitor people. We have a dedicated relocation partner to help you move to Finland. If you are currently living in Estonia or Sweden there is no need for you to relocate should you want to work from home but we will help you if you do want to move.

We have different people with different backgrounds. Cultivating diversity and maintaining different opinions is the key to our success.

Want to see the impact of your work? We provide our merchants with innovative tools and systems to become more and more efficient and successful, and with that our customers would also get a better experience when ordering with Wolt. We simply make it win-win for everyone!

This role can be based in one of our tech hubs inor, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.



Hands-on: We are looking for people who havebuilding high-quality software. This can include working with Apps, APIs and integrations, handling the whole development cycle all the way to production. Having said that, seniority at Wolt is measured by skills, not the number of years on your CV.

Skilled: We want you to be proficient withon the backend. We find expertise in otherlikegenuinely relevant as a starting off point for learning Kotlin.

Communicator & collaborator: We work closely with our teammates and having a good connection with team members is essential. We understand that everyone has their own unique way of communicating with others. We expect you to be yourself, express your opinions, and work together with the rest of the team.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Claudia Medri (claudia.medri@wolt.com).



Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

The Engineering team at Aiven lies at the core of our organization.

We are looking for a Senior Product Manager to join our reporting focused team called Bobby Tables. Our number-crunching service aggregates data from multiple sources within and outside Smartly.io making it one of the most data-heavy parts of the application. Customers can analyze performance of their ad campaigns by using the flexible report builder and data visualizer tool our team has developed.

Besides providing a customer-facing interface to the online analytical processing (OLAP) system that allows it to run complex analysis, the service offers programmatic access to the Reporting engine powering such features as automated actions and automated budget optimizations. The challenges lie in different areas: the scale of the database (several terabytes of data), complexity of database queries powered by flexible query language exposed as REST API, having numerous stakeholders both on client and data ingestion sides. The data structures have been evolving from being focused on one ad serving channel to being abstract cross-channel.

As a Senior Product Manager in this team, you will be leading the vision and execution of enhancing our reporting services to a whole new level. Based on feedback from our customers we want to work on even better visualization, data integrations, and data injections in our reporting services. Your role will involve analyzing these customer needs and developing a strategy to address them. You will work closely with the team to ensure the successful implementation of these changes and to deliver a high-quality reporting service that meets our customers' expectations.

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

The online travel industry is an extremely dynamic and competitive space. We aim to deliver compelling designs that create a world-class customer experience. You will have a key role in defining the future of our products that reach millions of customers. Despite our size, we operate in a startup-like environment.

This is an amazing opportunity if you’re looking for an exciting adventure abroad while expanding your international research capabilities. You get a chance to live in one of the most beautiful and most visited cities in the world!





We’re obsessed with creating compelling experiences for our millions of customers, across our travel booking experiences. We want to make travel easy, and for everyone with an all-in-one shop experience on Agoda.

The Marketing Product Team is trying to bring users, directly or through paid channels, to Agoda, so that over time, when users think of travel, they think of Agoda first. The team is highly data-driven and focused on developing at-scale, measurable, marketing programs & features that improve the lifetime value of Agoda customers. With travel being an infrequently used product, this is far more challenging to do than in a regular e-commerce context. The role of research thus becomes increasingly important, to help us understand how users decide where to book, how we can become their default choice, and so on. Of course, as a highly data-driven company, all insights need to translate into compelling data, as our UX researchers partner with product managers and analysts.







You will own end-to-end planning, execution, analysis, and reporting of research projects, and you will need to consistently achieve research outputs required by the design team and product team for their pursuits and occasionally inform strategic decisions in Product approach or business domain direction:

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me.

If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.







The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers.

Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us.

Are you ready to embark on an exciting journey into the heart of data transformation in one of Finland’s largest financial institutions? OP Life Insurance is now on the lookout for an accomplished Data Engineer to join our dynamic and growing team in Vallila, Helsinki!

What is your future role like?

We are currently seeking an experienced data professional to fill the role of Data Engineer and join our growing numbers at OP Life Insurance! At OP, we are making significant investments in enhancing our data capabilities to align with our business strategy. Our focus is on fostering data-driven decision-making and pushing forward the fundamental pillars of our data vision growth, customer experience, and efficiency. We are driving this progress through the application of data and analytics use cases. We are currently in the process of transitioning from on-premises systems to a cloud-based platform, and we're offering you the chance to be a part of this transformation and work with cutting-edge technologies.

In your day-to-day work, you will play a crucial role in our ongoing platform transformation, which will support our future business needs. In this renewal, we are transforming our insurance business into a new Guidewire Insurance Suite platform. Thanks to this transformation, in the future we are going to be able to handle insurance, billing & collections and claims all in one platform!

Furthermore, as a Data Engineer in OP Life Insurance you will get to work in our risk life renewal program and its data integration team. Your role will include technical data integration, covering both operational integrations and the utilization of operational analytics. In this role, you will have excellent opportunities for continuous professional development and learning from multi-skilled colleagues while simultaneously bringing your own expertise to the table.

The opportunity is available in Helsinki and like the rest of OP, we work in a flexible manner, combining both office days and remote work.



Our recruitment is not meant to seem like a puzzle, so we strive to tell you as clearly as possible what kind of expertise we believe is crucial to thriving in this role. Foremost we hope that you are someone with experience with Data Engineering work and thrive to continuously learn more!

Here are some of the requirements and technologies you will work with include



We understand that you might not have experience in all these areas just yet, but what really matters is your motivation and willingness to learn and grow. At OP Life, we also highly value the ability to work effectively within a team and, when needed, the ability to step up and take leadership in projects. Demonstrating initiative, strong teamwork skills, and a positive attitude are essential attributes we seek. We also hope you are able to communicate clearly and understandably in English and/or Finnish, as effective communication is vital for successful collaboration within our diverse team.



To help counterbalance work where you are expected to take a lot of responsibility, we seek to ensure employee wellbeing and to enable forward-looking work arrangements. We offer a stable working environment where you can contribute to our core values responsibility, people first and succeeding together.

You will enjoy a wide range of staff benefits, including a personnel fund and special terms for employee banking, insurance and loan services. We offer comprehensive occupational health care, extensive medical treatment expenses insurance and a full-time group accident insurance policy. Furthermore, we invest in wellbeing at work by encouraging a good work-life balance, providing flexibility in your daily life, and offering lunch, sport and cultural benefits and opportunities for affordable holidays in OP timeshares.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called “70/20/10 rule” in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great – that’s what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

Our Tech Lead Abhishek Dutta (tel. +358 50 410 4235) will be happy to answer your questions. You can reach Abhishek best on the following dates and times Thursday, November 2nd, from 2 PM to 3 PM and Friday, November 3rd, from 2 PM to 3 PM. Talk to you soon future colleague!

In the financial sector, our business is founded on trust and accountability, which is why the successful candidate will be checked for credit history and corporate connections, must take a drug test and a security clearance vetting made by the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service.

Equality and diversity are highly valued at OP Financial Group. We welcome job applications from people of all kinds, regardless of their gender identity or age, or the culture or minority group with which they identify.

Are you ready to embark on an exciting journey into the heart of data transformation in one of Finland’s largest financial institutions? OP Life Insurance is now on the lookout for an accomplished Data Engineer to join our dynamic and growing team in Vallila, Helsinki!

What is your future role like?

We are currently seeking an experienced data professional to fill the role of Data Engineer and join our growing numbers at OP Life Insurance! At OP, we are making significant investments in enhancing our data capabilities to align with our business strategy. Our focus is on fostering data-driven decision-making and pushing forward the fundamental pillars of our data vision growth, customer experience, and efficiency. We are driving this progress through the application of data and analytics use cases. We are currently in the process of transitioning from on-premises systems to a cloud-based platform, and we're offering you the chance to be a part of this transformation and work with cutting-edge technologies.

In your day-to-day work, you will play a crucial role in our ongoing platform transformation, which will support our future business needs. In this renewal, we are transforming our insurance business into a new Guidewire Insurance Suite platform. Thanks to this transformation, in the future we are going to be able to handle insurance, billing & collections and claims all in one platform!

Furthermore, as a Data Engineer in OP Life Insurance you will get to work in our risk life renewal program and its data integration team. Your role will include technical data integration, covering both operational integrations and the utilization of operational analytics. In this role, you will have excellent opportunities for continuous professional development and learning from multi-skilled colleagues while simultaneously bringing your own expertise to the table.

The opportunity is available in Helsinki and like the rest of OP, we work in a flexible manner, combining both office days and remote work.



Our recruitment is not meant to seem like a puzzle, so we strive to tell you as clearly as possible what kind of expertise we believe is crucial to thriving in this role. Foremost we hope that you are someone with experience with Data Engineering work and thrive to continuously learn more!

Here are some of the requirements and technologies you will work with include



We understand that you might not have experience in all these areas just yet, but what really matters is your motivation and willingness to learn and grow. At OP Life, we also highly value the ability to work effectively within a team and, when needed, the ability to step up and take leadership in projects. Demonstrating initiative, strong teamwork skills, and a positive attitude are essential attributes we seek. We also hope you are able to communicate clearly and understandably in English and/or Finnish, as effective communication is vital for successful collaboration within our diverse team.



To help counterbalance work where you are expected to take a lot of responsibility, we seek to ensure employee wellbeing and to enable forward-looking work arrangements. We offer a stable working environment where you can contribute to our core values responsibility, people first and succeeding together.

You will enjoy a wide range of staff benefits, including a personnel fund and special terms for employee banking, insurance and loan services. We offer comprehensive occupational health care, extensive medical treatment expenses insurance and a full-time group accident insurance policy. Furthermore, we invest in wellbeing at work by encouraging a good work-life balance, providing flexibility in your daily life, and offering lunch, sport and cultural benefits and opportunities for affordable holidays in OP timeshares.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called “70/20/10 rule” in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great – that’s what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

Our Tech Lead Abhishek Dutta (tel. +358 50 410 4235) will be happy to answer your questions. You can reach Abhishek best on the following dates and times Thursday, November 2nd, from 2 PM to 3 PM and Friday, November 3rd, from 2 PM to 3 PM. Talk to you soon future colleague!

In the financial sector, our business is founded on trust and accountability, which is why the successful candidate will be checked for credit history and corporate connections, must take a drug test and a security clearance vetting made by the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service.

Equality and diversity are highly valued at OP Financial Group. We welcome job applications from people of all kinds, regardless of their gender identity or age, or the culture or minority group with which they identify.

Are you ready to embark on an exciting journey into the heart of data transformation in one of Finland’s largest financial institutions? OP Life Insurance is now on the lookout for an accomplished Data Engineer to join our dynamic and growing team in Vallila, Helsinki!

What is your future role like?

We are currently seeking an experienced data professional to fill the role of Data Engineer and join our growing numbers at OP Life Insurance! At OP, we are making significant investments in enhancing our data capabilities to align with our business strategy.

We are driving this progress through the application of data and analytics use cases. We are currently in the process of transitioning from on-premises systems to a cloud-based platform, and we're offering you the chance to be a part of this transformation and work with cutting-edge technologies.

In your day-to-day work, you will play a crucial role in our ongoing platform transformation, which will support our future business needs. In this renewal, we are transforming our insurance business into a new Guidewire Insurance Suite platform. Thanks to this transformation, in the future we are going to be able to handle insurance, billing & collections and claims all in one platform!

Furthermore, as a Data Engineer in OP Life Insurance you will get to work in our risk life renewal program and its data integration team. Your role will include technical data integration, covering both operational integrations and the utilization of operational analytics. In this role, you will have excellent opportunities for continuous professional development and learning from multi-skilled colleagues while simultaneously bringing your own expertise to the table.

The opportunity is available in Helsinki and like the rest of OP, we work in a flexible manner, combining both office days and remote work.



Our recruitment is not meant to seem like a puzzle, so we strive to tell you as clearly as possible what kind of expertise we believe is crucial to thriving in this role. Foremost we hope that you are someone with experience with Data Engineering work and thrive to continuously learn more!

Here are some of the requirements and technologies you will work with include



We understand that you might not have experience in all these areas just yet, but what really matters is your motivation and willingness to learn and grow. At OP Life, we also highly value the ability to work effectively within a team and, when needed, the ability to step up and take leadership in projects. Demonstrating initiative, strong teamwork skills, and a positive attitude are essential attributes we seek. We also hope you are able to communicate clearly and understandably in English and/or Finnish, as effective communication is vital for successful collaboration within our diverse team.



To help counterbalance work where you are expected to take a lot of responsibility, we seek to ensure employee wellbeing and to enable forward-looking work arrangements. We offer a stable working environment where you can contribute to our core values responsibility, people first and succeeding together.

You will enjoy a wide range of staff benefits, including a personnel fund and special terms for employee banking, insurance and loan services. We offer comprehensive occupational health care, extensive medical treatment expenses insurance and a full-time group accident insurance policy. Furthermore, we invest in wellbeing at work by encouraging a good work-life balance, providing flexibility in your daily life, and offering lunch, sport and cultural benefits and opportunities for affordable holidays in OP timeshares.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called “70/20/10 rule” in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great – that’s what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

Our Tech Lead Abhishek Dutta (tel. +358 50 410 4235) will be happy to answer your questions. You can reach Abhishek best on the following dates and times Thursday, November 2nd, from 2 PM to 3 PM and Friday, November 3rd, from 2 PM to 3 PM. Talk to you soon future colleague!

In the financial sector, our business is founded on trust and accountability, which is why the successful candidate will be checked for credit history and corporate connections, must take a drug test and a security clearance vetting made by the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service.

Equality and diversity are highly valued at OP Financial Group. We welcome job applications from people of all kinds, regardless of their gender identity or age, or the culture or minority group with which they identify.

What is your future role like?

We are currently in the process of transitioning from on-premises systems to a cloud-based platform, and we're offering you the chance to be a part of this transformation and work with cutting-edge technologies.

In your day-to-day work, you will play a crucial role in our ongoing platform transformation, which will support our future business needs. In this renewal, we are transforming our insurance business into a new Guidewire Insurance Suite platform. Thanks to this transformation, in the future we are going to be able to handle insurance, billing & collections and claims all in one platform!

Furthermore, as a Data Engineer in OP Life Insurance you will get to work in our risk life renewal program and its data integration team. Your role will include technical data integration, covering both operational integrations and the utilization of operational analytics.

Our recruitment is not meant to seem like a puzzle, so we strive to tell you as clearly as possible what kind of expertise we believe is crucial to thriving in this role. Foremost we hope that you are someone with experience with Data Engineering work and thrive to continuously learn more!

We understand that you might not have experience in all these areas just yet, but what really matters is your motivation and willingness to learn and grow. At OP Life, we also highly value the ability to work effectively within a team and, when needed, the ability to step up and take leadership in projects. Demonstrating initiative, strong teamwork skills, and a positive attitude are essential attributes we seek. We also hope you are able to communicate clearly and understandably in English and/or Finnish, as effective communication is vital for successful collaboration within our diverse team.



To help counterbalance work where you are expected to take a lot of responsibility, we seek to ensure employee wellbeing and to enable forward-looking work arrangements. We offer a stable working environment where you can contribute to our core values responsibility, people first and succeeding together.

You will enjoy a wide range of staff benefits, including a personnel fund and special terms for employee banking, insurance and loan services. We offer comprehensive occupational health care, extensive medical treatment expenses insurance and a full-time group accident insurance policy. Furthermore, we invest in wellbeing at work by encouraging a good work-life balance, providing flexibility in your daily life, and offering lunch, sport and cultural benefits and opportunities for affordable holidays in OP timeshares.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called “70/20/10 rule” in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great – that’s what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?
