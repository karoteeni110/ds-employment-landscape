We're looking for a Data Engineer to help us in our mission to spread joy through singing. In this role, you will build the data infrastructure that shapes Singa’s song catalog and overall product experience!

As Singa is going through a growth phase, rebuilding its analytics infrastructure is paramount. It’s a complex problem as Singa offers multi-platform products and has multiple revenue sources being processed natively on each platform and through external invoicing systems across several territories.

As the company grows, getting accurate product, sales, and marketing KPIs data becomes increasingly crucial. Hence, the candidate has a big opportunity to provide an outsized impact on the company's future.

If you're interested in leaving your mark on popular culture by utilizing your skills in data engineering, you've found the job for you!











Singing belongs to everyone, not just professionals and pop stars. It's something fundamental to us humans. That's why we invented Singa - a modern streaming service for karaoke accessible by anyone, anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

We're building the future of singing by doing the same for karaoke that Netflix did for movies and Spotify for music — updating an entire industry. We are uniquely positioned to become the biggest brand in a global market representing a 15 billion dollar opportunity.



Let’s face it. Life without karaoke is boring. Luckily, Singa comes to the rescue at home and Singa-powered karaoke venues worldwide.

The Singa karaoke app gives consumers access to a massive library of high-quality karaoke songs on mobile, web browsers, and Smart TVs. You can sing alone, make it a party with friends, or find the nearest Singa-powered karaoke venue and hit the stage.

On the B2B side, Singa helps pubs, bars, and other nightlife venues grow revenues with professional karaoke, background music, and display advertising software. We have a rapidly growing network of over 1,000 venues in Europe and the USA.



In karaoke, everyone can be themselves; the same applies to Singa. It doesn’t matter how, where, or when you work as long as it gets done. Individual freedom is coupled with equal amounts of responsibility and ownership.

We are all different but united in our ambition to make an impact on pop culture and our shared mission of making the world sing. Not to mention a few karaoke parties here and there, free singing lessons, epic staff trips, and other related shenanigans to keep it all interesting.



Step 1: Recruitment call

Step 2: First Interview - 30-minute video call with engineering team members.

Step 3: A homework assignment (code review).

Step 4: Second Interview - 45-minute co-working session with our engineering team members and product managers. Remote or on location, depending on preference and restrictions.

Step 5: Founder interview - 30-minute interview with our CEO founder

Step 6: Offer letter and contract signing

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

Description

Are you passionate about data engineering and data architecture? Would you like to build solutions that create actual business value? At Nitor, we help our clients to succeed with data.



As a Senior Data Engineer at Nitor, your aim is to help our customers extract business value from data with a pragmatic approach, focusing on solving their challenges with the right tools. Your responsibilities might include creating data-intensive applications, automating and orchestrating data pipelines, and simplifying complex technical entities into more common-sense solutions.

Communication with the customer is crucial, and training our customer’s experts to use and maintain the provided solution is also an intriguing part of your job.

Our customer projects are typically challenging yet professionally rewarding. The projects provide an experienced Senior Data Engineer with the possibility to widely utilize and deepen their skill set. The duration of the projects usually ranges between one year and multiple years, depending on your preferences. Our data business unit Nitor Insight, established in 2018, is a tight-knit and startup-like community with an exceptionally high level of data know-how.









A set of benefits that makes a difference

In addition to meaningful projects and customized possibilities for professional development, we offer you a profound set of employee benefits. Nitor is built in a way that it can support your career development, sustainable work pace, and well-being.

Extremely high expertise and pride for our own and our colleagues' work are things we all have in common. We work with the largest enterprises in Finland, helping them succeed in building a better digital world.

Our growth is solid; for example, our turnover grew by 8,2% in 2021. In 2022, Onway's research gave us the best place for customer satisfaction in the IT sector for the tenth time.

At Nitor, you can trust us to take care of everything else, allowing you to focus entirely on your work.

Perehdyt lisäksi myös finanssialaa sekä digitaalista liiketoimintaa koskevaan sääntelyyn. Tulet tukemaan tehtävässä tietosuoja-asiantuntijoidemme sekä tietosuojan asiakaspalvelutiimin arkea sekä toimimaan erilaisissa henkilötietojen käsittelyyn liittyvissä selvittämis- ja ohjaustehtävissä.

Sinulla on oikeustieteellinen korkeakoulututkinto tai olet vastaavien opintojesi loppuvaiheessa. Voit olla myös opintojen alkuvaiheessa, mikäli olet tukenut opintojasi tietosuojaan liittyvällä harjoittelulla.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

RELEX Solutions create cutting-edge optimisation software to help retailers and consumer brands drive profitable growth. With growth comes opportunities, and we embrace both. Within our platforms, our teams are driving change, working with international colleagues and the latest tech stack to develop solutions that transform into a pioneering end product; it’s tangible and impactful – for our customers and the world.



Our Technology team enjoy a challenge. They’re hungry to learn, and don’t hesitate to ask what, why, and how. They get to work with various technologies to create high quality scalable applications (just imagine, thousands of stores, millions of products, and billions of rows of raw data!). Their expertise positively impacts the environment and business processes around the world; alongside international colleagues, they drive change and develop solutions that become our pioneering end product. From functional programming, machine learning and interesting algorithms, to building big data pipelines, they’re behind it all. They can work in a flexible way, remote or in-office – after all, they contribute to all our achievements, so we reward them with genuine work-life balance and access to every opportunity.

We are now looking for anto join our Information Security team in Helsinki.



Our customers give us access to some highly confidential business data. As Information Security Expert your job is to continuously develop security compliance at RELEX to prove to our customers that their data is safe with us, and to ensure that we comply with industry best practices for security. You will join our very experienced information security team that is responsible for information and software security. Together with our security owners and product owners you will develop our security controls and work with our external auditors to maintain our ISO 27001 certification and ISAE 3000 SOC 2 Type II attestation. RELEX is a SaaS company with a “Cloud first” approach, so you will have the opportunity to work with modern technologies and SaaS providers.

To succeed in your role, you need to have good communications skills and be good at planning and working across multiple functions. Our team is in the rare position of being able to communicate with and influence any other team, and we are working closely with all departments. At RELEX, our unique approach to security compliance is focused on awareness and cooperation. We want the teams to own their own security controls and to be able to improve security on their own. In audits the evidence is presented by the teams, not by the security team. This is also reflected in our highly collaborative approach in internal audits – or ‘awareness sessions’, as we prefer to call them.



Your job is to maintain and develop our security certifications in close cooperation with our security owners and their teams. As we add new components and services to our offering, you help to ensure that the security controls are implemented consistently and work as expected, and that we have the evidence for this to show our customers. You maintain an open and honest culture around security, helping teams develop their security operations with transparency and auditability in mind. As part of your job, you improve visibility into our security operations, evaluating tooling and services and help deploy them.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme!

Innostutko datasta ja tahdot päästä hyödyntämään tietoteknistä osaamistasi finanssialan työtehtävien parissa? Vahvistamme Kehittäminen ja teknologiat -organisaatiomme Henkilöasiakasrahoitus ja asumisen palvelut -heimoa Data Analyst Traineella Helsingissä!



Traineena tehtävänäsi on avustaa OPn Henkilöasiakasrahoitus ja asumisen palvelut -heimon liiketoimintaraportoinnin kehittämisessä. Etsit dataa ja tuotat analyyseja ja raportteja, jotka tukevat liiketoiminnan kehitystä ja vaikuttavat liiketoimintapäätöksiin.

Trainee-jakson tavoitteita ja painopisteitä on myös mahdollista räätälöidä aiemman kokemuksesi ja mielenkiinnon kohteidesi mukaisesti.



Etsimämme trainee on ennen kaikkea kiinnostunut datan hyödyntämisestä pankkiliiketoiminnassa ja haluaa kehittää osaamistaan tällä alalla. Hän kykenee analyyttiseen ajatteluun ja pitää numeroiden kanssa työskentelystä. Etsimämme henkilö ei tyydy helppoon ratkaisuun vaan pyrkii ymmärtämään liiketoimintaa ja siihen liittyviä haasteita syvällisesti.

Katsomme tehtävän kannalta eduksi vahvat tietotekniset taidot sekä raportointityökalujen ja ohjelmointikielten tuntemuksen. Katsomme eduksi myös tilastollisten menetelmien ja koneoppimismenetelmien tuntemuksen, kirjanpidon ja laskentatoimen tuntemuksen sekä kokemuksen työskentelystä contact centerissa.

Työyhteisössä toimit oma-aloitteisesti, kuitenkin ympärilläsi olevat ihmiset huomioon ottaen. Saatat hyvinkin olla hakemamme osaaja, jos työskentelytapasi on systemaattinen ja ratkaisukeskeinen. Kommunikointi- ja vuorovaikutustaitosi ovat erinomaiset ja verkostoituminen on sinulle luontevaa. Hallitset viestinnän niin suullisesti kuin sähköisissä kanavissa. Sinulla on matemaattistekninen korkeakoulutasoinen koulutus sekä sujuva suomen ja englannin kielen taito.



Meillä pääset tutustumaan siihen, miten ketterää ohjelmistokehitystä tehdään ison finanssialan toimijan monitiimiympäristössä. Harjoittelujakson aikana saat kattavan ymmärryksen modernin ohjelmistotalon työtavasta ja -kulttuurista sekä siitä, miten tiimin tekemiseen on mahdollista vaikuttaa.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa Competence Lead Marko Kiviniemi (puh. +358 40 738 8248) aikoina ke 25.10 klo 14.00-15.00 ja ti 31.10 klo 14.00-15.00.

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet, teetetään huumausainetesti sekä suojelupoliisin perusmuotoinen turvallisuusselvitys.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Our vision is to become the trusted open source data platform for everyone. We are a Cast of over 400 individuals (‘Crabs’) located across the globe. Why Crabs? Because we believe in thinking sideways. And right now, we’re looking for sideways-thinking engineers.

The Engineering team at Aiven lies at the core of our organization. This is a great opportunity to become an integral member of the team as a Staff Software Engineer. We look for engineers who can work around problems by finding new angles. Thinking sideways.

And in the spirit of sideways thinking, we’re by their side as well. Actively helping them solve their challenges. Collaborating. Sharing. And innovating. In other words, it really isn’t just about who we are. It’s about who our customers are – and where they want to be.



We want individuals who can embody our values of ownership, courage, and openness.

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don’t falter – we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We’re always open to new ideas – from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on our cloud operations platform turning the best open source technologies into frustration-free cloud services. You’ll be part of a team working on the Aiven cloud platform, improving its scalability and reliability, implementing new features as well as extending our product portfolio of open source data technologies

Job Description

Data Scientists at Wolt are working with machine learning for the most important processes and parts of Wolt’s online delivery platform and business operations that affect all the 23 countries we operate in. The work consists of owning machine learning use cases as part of a product or business team; starting from identifying opportunities, to developing and prototyping a solution, all the way to deploying, maintaining, and improving a production-ready solution inside of the embedded product team. We use a variety of technologies and tools including Python, SQL, Spark, Docker and K8s, Snowflake, Looker, Flyte, Seldon Core, Airflow, MLflow and Kafka to get the job done, and constantly looking for ways to improve how our data scientists work. 💪💪

We are looking for a data scientist to be embedded into our cross-functional, working together with engineers, product and analytics people, focusing on improving our demand forecasting algorithms. The team is responsible for helpingto meet the customer demand by keeping item availability high, while optimizing store space usage and minimising waste. As an expert on forecasting, you’ll help to raise the bar and impact of forecasting across the whole organization.

You wonder whatis? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform. Wolt Market delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing.

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office.

Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.





What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position you can turn to Group Talent Acquisition Partner / Analytics, Michal Szafraniec at michal.szafraniec@wolt.com

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you’re interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

We are now looking for experienced Senior Server Engineers to join either the Hay Day or Brawl Stars team. As a Server Engineer at Supercell, you are an integral member of a game team, working closely with other game developers and focusing on making sure that our hundreds of millions of monthly players get the best, most uninterrupted experience possible. Depending on the game and your own interests, you can focus more on the general game server infrastructure or new game feature development – and sometimes you do both.

Communication between server engineers in different game teams is absolutely vital to our success. Our server engineers frequently share learnings, both successes and failures, across game teams to make each team better. You must be humble, pragmatic and willing to admit and explain your mistakes. That way, the next time something goes wrong, we'll all be better prepared.

If you have experience in developing live systems and using virtualized computing, and you understand what it means to support a system with large user volumes, you might just be the person we're looking for!








Luring you in with glitter, glamour, and gems is not what we seek to do. We develop Supercell as an employer for you to do your best work and to call this the best experience in your professional life.

We want you to enjoy your time here fully, so we structure our compensation and benefits to serve this purpose. It starts with perceiving you as a human being, not a resource.


We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games – played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.


Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you're bringing along.

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.


The Data department oversees all of Agoda’s data-related requirements. Our ultimate goal is to enable and increase the use of data in the company through creative approaches and the implementation of powerful resources such as operational and analytical databases, queue systems, BI tools, and data science technology. We hire the brightest minds from around the world to take on this challenge and equip them with the knowledge and tools that contribute to their personal growth and success while supporting our company’s culture of diversity and experimentation. The role the Data team plays at Agoda is critical as business users, product managers, engineers, and many others rely on us to empower their decision making. We are equally dedicated to our customers by improving their search experience with faster results and protecting them from any fraudulent activities. Data is interesting only when you have enough of it, and we have plenty. This is what drives up the challenge as part of the Data department, but also the reward.


We think of Data Science in Agoda differently. For us, a data scientist is a fusion of core production skills with analytic and business skills. We’ve brought top talents from (literally) all over the world who focus relentlessly on building products which utilize ML and AI as their main edge. We know that when you infuse ML and technology, you move from good to great and that is our mission. Our Data Science managers are action driven leaders that can form vivid vision and successfully direct their people to execute it while being strongly rooted in the details and practice.

As a Data Science Manager, you will:

You are a developer of people. You love leading diverse teams of professionals with both qualitative and quantitative backgrounds using data-driven and insights-led approaches to respond quickly in a dynamic, competitive, and fast changing industry.

Tackle complex problems in the online travel and ecommerce space using a range of ML and data analysis methods. Use our huge data repositories to push our business metrics to their bounds, directly and indirectly. Foster a culture that constantly raises the bar for us and others and supports the freedom to explore and innovate.

Can we detect causation between metrics and bookings? How can automatically answer our users’ questions? How do we tune our AB testing platform to ensure we aren’t optimizing noise? How do we measure experiment success to properly trade off type I and II errors? What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it? How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack. You will be impacting every aspect of the business and it will require various techniques, from diving deep into data with SQL and Big Data tools, all the way to deploying modern machine learning models.

. Work directly with the heads of the business departments and the product management team. Influence them with compelling product ideas based on data insights that can move the dial on our business.





We welcome both local and international applications for this role. Full visa sponsorship and relocation assistance available for eligible candidates.

Job Description

We are looking for a Product Lead to join our Consumer Search team. The search team is responsible for enabling Wolt users to find all that they need, easily.

What does it mean in practice? We are on an exciting journey building the best search experience in the industry that delights our customers. Whether they are looking for pasta (whether from their favorite restaurant or from a grocery store nearby), an ethernet cable for the PS5 they just copped, or the trendiest organic shop in their city, we aim to make it easy to find it and to deliver it promptly to their doorstep. We want to make entire cities discoverable via Wolt’s search experience.

As a Product Lead, you will work with a cross-functional team of incredibly talented engineering, design, product and analytics humans in a high visibility role. You will be responsible for defining the roadmap and setting the vision for your team. This involves leading multiple projects and cross-team product initiatives across the entire product lifecycle, partnering with business and operations stakeholders as well as understanding our end-users better than anyone.

Your home base will be Wolt’s product management team but you will be working on a daily basis with the Consumer Search team but also with the business operations and country team, who are responsible for the global and local businesses. When it comes to career progression, this role has a fairly clear path to a more strategy-focused and leadership-oriented role (e.g. head of product) over time, as one delivers impact. We’ll let you in on a little secret: most of Wolt’s product people leads today have been promoted from within 🥳.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in,or, or you can work remotely anywhere in,,,, and. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.



You could come to this role from a multitude of different backgrounds, but ideally, you have





The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Elif Dilan Ayaz (elifdilan.ayaz@wolt.com).



Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Cubiq Analytics on analytiikkatalo, jossa alan parhaat osaajat haluavat olla töissä. Tehtävämme on toteuttaa suomalaisissa organisaatioissa ennennäkemättömiä läpimurtoja datan avulla.





Onko voima kanssasi? Hyvä! Etsimme tiimiimme jo kokemusta kerryttänyttä Senior Power BI -konsulttia. Oletko sinä etsimämme vahva osaaja?

Tehtävänäsi on kehittää asiakkaillemme pilvipohjaisia analytiikkaratkaisuja Power BI:n avulla. Valomiekkoja emme tällä kertaa tarvitse, mutta Power BI:n tulisi olla hyvin hyppysissäsi. Haemmekin tiimiimme jo kokemusta kerryttänyttä osaajaa, joka hallitsee datan visualisoinnin lisäksi myös sen mallinnuksen. Senior konsulttina olet oman alasi asiantuntija ja jaat osaamistasi mielelläsi niin Cubiqin sisällä kuin asiakastöissäsi: otteesi on sparraava ja tuot aktiivisesti uusia ideoita esiin.

Power BI -tekemisemme kasvaa kohisten, mutta talostamme löytyy jo valmiiksi muita Power BI -osaajia, eikä asioita tarvitse pähkäillä ja pallotella koskaan yksin. Cubiqille tullessasi tuletkin osaksi yhteisöä. Meillä töitä tehdään vahvasti tiimeissä, ja asiakkuuden koosta riippuen tiimissäsi on monesti myös Data Engineerejä ja/tai web-devaajia. Asiakkaamme ovat suuria ja keskisuuria suomalaisia yrityksiä ja julkishallinnon organisaatioita, mikä takaa mielekkäät projektit ja oman osaamisen kehittymisen. Emme ole toimialasidonnaisia, joten asiakkaamme ja toimeksiantomme vaihtelevat laidasta laitaan. Pääsetkin laajentamaan ymmärrystäsi datan ja analytiikan arvoketjun valjastamisesta organisaation tarpeisiin hyvin monipuolisesti.

Rekrytointiprosessin aikana kartoitamme osaamistasi ja intohimoasi analytiikkaa kohtaan, jotta olisimme paras mahdollinen match toisillemme. Meillä ei ole turhaa byrokratiaa, joten rakennamme roolisi ja urapolkusi näiden keskustelujen ja kiinnostuksenkohteidesi pohjalta.












Olemme osa globaalin insinööri-, suunnittelu- ja konsultointiyritys AFRYn Management Consulting -liiketoimintayksikköä. Meillä pääset osaksi energistä ja osallistavaa yhteisöä, jossa on loistava tekemisen meininki ja työtäsi arvostetaan. Saat vaikuttaa aidosti asioihin ja luotsata omia visioitasi eteenpäin. Vapauden ja vastuun lisäksi takaamme joustavan työympäristön sekä kilpailukykyiset edut. Toimistomme sijaitsevat Helsingissä, Lahdessa, Tampereella ja Turussa.

“Cubiqilla työskentelyssä parasta on työkaverit sekä vaihtelevat projektit. Monipuolisten työtehtävien ansiosta pääsen kehittämään omaa osaamistani, sillä asiakkaiden tarpeet ja ympäristöt ovat erilaisia. Välillä rakennan talouden Power BI -sovellusta ja seuraavana päivänä kehitän asiakkaan Azure-ympäristöä.

Senior konsulttina olet oman alasi asiantuntija ja jaat osaamistasi mielelläsi niin Cubiqin sisällä kuin asiakastöissäsi: otteesi on sparraava ja tuot aktiivisesti uusia ideoita esiin.

Power BI -tekemisemme kasvaa kohisten, mutta talostamme löytyy jo valmiiksi muita Power BI -osaajia, eikä asioita tarvitse pähkäillä ja pallotella koskaan yksin. Cubiqille tullessasi tuletkin osaksi yhteisöä. Meillä töitä tehdään vahvasti tiimeissä, ja asiakkuuden koosta riippuen tiimissäsi on monesti myös Data Engineerejä ja/tai web-devaajia. Asiakkaamme ovat suuria ja keskisuuria suomalaisia yrityksiä ja julkishallinnon organisaatioita, mikä takaa mielekkäät projektit ja oman osaamisen kehittymisen. Emme ole toimialasidonnaisia, joten asiakkaamme ja toimeksiantomme vaihtelevat laidasta laitaan. Pääsetkin laajentamaan ymmärrystäsi datan ja analytiikan arvoketjun valjastamisesta organisaation tarpeisiin hyvin monipuolisesti.

Rekrytointiprosessin aikana kartoitamme osaamistasi ja intohimoasi analytiikkaa kohtaan, jotta olisimme paras mahdollinen match toisillemme. Meillä ei ole turhaa byrokratiaa, joten rakennamme roolisi ja urapolkusi näiden keskustelujen ja kiinnostuksenkohteidesi pohjalta.












Olemme osa globaalin insinööri-, suunnittelu- ja konsultointiyritys AFRYn Management Consulting -liiketoimintayksikköä. Meillä pääset osaksi energistä ja osallistavaa yhteisöä, jossa on loistava tekemisen meininki ja työtäsi arvostetaan. Saat vaikuttaa aidosti asioihin ja luotsata omia visioitasi eteenpäin. Vapauden ja vastuun lisäksi takaamme joustavan työympäristön sekä kilpailukykyiset edut. Toimistomme sijaitsevat Helsingissä, Lahdessa, Tampereella ja Turussa.

Mitä mieltä töistään ja Cubiqista on meillä Power BI:llä päivittäin ratkaisuja tekevä Senior konsultti Johanna?

“Cubiqilla työskentelyssä parasta on työkaverit sekä vaihtelevat projektit. Monipuolisten työtehtävien ansiosta pääsen kehittämään omaa osaamistani, sillä asiakkaiden tarpeet ja ympäristöt ovat erilaisia. Välillä rakennan talouden Power BI -sovellusta ja seuraavana päivänä kehitän asiakkaan Azure-ympäristöä. Omien taitojen syventyminen onkin takuuvarmaa, ja Cubiqilla on tullut opittua lyhyessä ajassa paljon!”

Job Description

Role background

Trust and Safety is a new global team at Wolt, focused on proactively mitigating trust and safety risks on the Wolt platform. It is a key priority for us that everyone can feel safe while using Wolt - be it for ordering, delivering or selling goods.

As the Head of Global Trust and Safety, you will have the unique opportunity to drive the development and execution of comprehensive strategies, policies, and initiatives that enhance safety and trust across our entire ecosystem.

Specifically, your work will be focused on reducing trust and safety incidents - to do so you will create policies on how to operate on the platform, you will identify root causes for incidents and form cross-functional teams to solve those, and will drive initiatives to increase the sentiment of safety on the platform.

In this role, you will partner closely with various global functions (including product, operations, legal, analytics, communications, and leadership) to drive forward company-wide projects with high strategic importance.

To succeed in the role, you must be comfortable working at both ends of the spectrum - you’ll be building the high-level strategy and also rolling up your sleeves to get things done!






If you are excited about working in a high-growth environment, taking ownership of things you care about, and being part of an ambitious group of professionals, then click below to apply and get the conversation going!

Along with a competitive salary and benefits, you will also be eligible for our stock option plan.

You will fit into a truly diverse team across 25 countries - what really matters to us is a caring and welcoming environment where we embrace uniqueness and celebrate diversity. Experience a company culture where we work on eye level, decisions are made quickly and knowledge sharing, as well as mentoring, is on our daily agenda.

If you have any further questions about the position, you can turn to:

Enrica Testa, Senior Talent Acqusition Partner at enrica.testa@wolt.com

Please note that we do not accept applications sent by mail. You should submit your application through our careers website!






You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

We work hard to make cities into better places, and it’s pretty cool seeing us grow every week. If you’re passionate about building things that just… work, Wolt might be for you.

The Research Group of Prof. Anna-Liisa Laine seeks three post doctoral researchers for an ERC funded Advanced Grant project “Coevolutionary consequences of biodiversity change; Co-EvoChange”. The main aim of the project is to uncover how human-imposed disturbance in plant communities affects the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions both above- and below ground, and how these changes scale up to ecosystem processes.



We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of above-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios. The selected candidate is expected to take part in designing their project and take full responsibility for its’ implementation from data collection to presentation of results in both scientific journals and conferences. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.








We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of below-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. We are also interested in how altered plant-microbe associations translate to soil ecosystem processes such as decomposition, microbial community growth and carbon use efficiency.

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plants communities. We will use a complementary analytical toolbox to identify how sensitive contemporary plant and microbial community structure and species interactions are to past biodiversity changes and environmental change. Relevant analytical approaches may include, but are not restricted to, Joint Species Distribution Model approaches (.g. HMSC; Sallinen et al. 2020), Random Markov Fields models (Norberg et al. 2023), and network analyses. The Ecological Memory framework can be used to quantify how much past plant biodiversity and environmental conditions affect contemporary plant-microbe associations and ecosystem functioning. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.






The salary of the successful candidate will be based on level 5 of the demands level chart for teaching and research personnel in the salary system of Finnish universities. In addition, the appointee will be paid a salary component based on personal performance. The starting salary will be ca 3400-3800 €/month. eurs/month, depending on the appointee’s qualifications and experience.

We are looking for a Senior Product Manager to join our reporting focused team called Bobby Tables. Our number-crunching service aggregates data from multiple sources within and outside Smartly.io making it one of the most data-heavy parts of the application. Customers can analyze performance of their ad campaigns by using the flexible report builder and data visualizer tool our team has developed.

Besides providing a customer-facing interface to the online analytical processing (OLAP) system that allows it to run complex analysis, the service offers programmatic access to the Reporting engine powering such features as automated actions and automated budget optimizations. The challenges lie in different areas: the scale of the database (several terabytes of data), complexity of database queries powered by flexible query language exposed as REST API, having numerous stakeholders both on client and data ingestion sides. The data structures have been evolving from being focused on one ad serving channel to being abstract cross-channel.

As a Senior Product Manager in this team, you will be leading the vision and execution of enhancing our reporting services to a whole new level. Based on feedback from our customers we want to work on even better visualization, data integrations, and data injections in our reporting services. Your role will involve analyzing these customer needs and developing a strategy to address them. You will work closely with the team to ensure the successful implementation of these changes and to deliver a high-quality reporting service that meets our customers' expectations.











Smartly.io is one of the world’s largest SaaS digital advertising platforms. We help brands better reach audiences, engage creatives and learn what performs best across the largest media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Snap, Pinterest, TikTok, and Google.

We manage nearly $5B in ad spend and help 700+ brands worldwide. Our leading end-to-end technology and outstanding customer helps brands like Walmart, FanDuel, L’Oreal, Warner Bros. Discovery, Nestle, and Disney/ESPN to better reach audiences, engage creatives and learn what performs best.

We offer growth-minded people opportunities to make an impact in a fast-paced, collaborative and inclusive environment built on a culture of trust, transparency, and feedback. You’ll work with a team of 600+ Smartlies, representing 60+ nationalities. We operate in 13 countries across 24 locations.

Job Description

The Cart & Checkout team is looking for a Senior Frontend developer to contribute new features for our awesome consumer-facing wolt.com website.

The team is responsible for the end-to-end user experience from the moment users choose the items they want to order all the way through to get them to confirm the purchase on the app and website. Some of the key focus areas of the team are basket management, cart review, checkout experience and group orders. The team is a cross-functional team of Frontend, Backend, iOS, Android, Data Analyst, Design, a Team lead and a Product Lead. Their mission is to offer Wolt grade order experience on our platform; helping consumers to order in a fast, easy and collaborative way while providing a delightful user experience in different product lines.

In this role, you’ll be working on improving and modifying the very app that millions of people in over 20 countries around the world see when ordering food and other products in Wolt. Our app is top-rated and we place a high value on an awesome end-user experience as well as a cutting-edge UI.

This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. 🌍


We are looking for someone with extensive react and typescript experience, capable of delivering modern, testable and maintainable code. Quality is something we strive for in every aspect of app development from the user interface to having a maintainable architecture and source code, so experience with testing processes is expected. Implementing automated unit & UI testing and collaborating with our excellent QA engineers to prevent regressions will be part of your daily work.

Together we are working not only on new projects, but also improving the user experience for our millions of active users. In addition to the software development skills, we are looking for a team player with great communication and collaboration skills, workload organisation, flexibility and an agile attitude along with a product oriented mindset. We expect you to have these too!


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Severi Kausola (severi.kausola@wolt.com).


Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great – that’s what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.



Engineering Manager Kristin Hybertsen is happy to provide information about the daily work and answer any questions you may have about the role. Kristin is best reached through Linkedin or email kristin.hybertsen(at)schibsted.com
