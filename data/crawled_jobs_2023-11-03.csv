Haluatko olla mukana muovaamassa tulevaisuuden datalähtöisiä pilvipalveluita? Olemme etsimässä Azure Data Architectia, joka ei pelkää hypätä uusimpien teknologioiden pyörteisiin ja haastaviin projekteihin. Tämä rooli vaatii syvällistä osaamista ja ammattitaitoa, mutta tarjoaa samalla mahdollisuuden vaikuttaa merkittävästi siihen, miten yritykset optimoivat dataansa liiketoiminnan kehittämisessä.TehtävästäAzure Data Architect -roolissa pääset rakentamaan tulevaisuuden dataratkaisuja, jotka eivät ole ainoastaan kestäviä, vaan myös innovatiivisia. Sinun tehtävänäsi on soveltaa uusimpia teknologioita yhdessä Cloud1:n kehittämien automaatiokonseptien kanssa, luoden samalla kestäviä ja kehittyviä ratkaisuja. Työskentelet syvällisesti Delta Lakehouse -ratkaisujen parissa hyödyntäen Azuren Synapse-pipelineja, Databricksin Unity Catalogia sekä älykkäitä tietovarastoratkaisuja. Tämän avulla mahdollistat datan monipuolisen hyödyntämisen analytiikassa, asiakasrajapinnoilla ja AI-malleissa. Myös Power Platformin työvälineet kuuluvat työkalupakkiisi, eikä analytiikka ole sinulle vain sivutuote. Et näe delta-tauluja ja *Spark-teknologiaa pelkästään koodiriveinä, vaan ymmärrät niiden voiman integraatioissa ja datan analysoinnissa. Liiketoiminnan päätöksenteko vaatii muutakin, kuin teknologiaa, joten arkkitehdin rooliin kuuluu kiinteästi myös analytiikka ja tiedonhallinta.Azure ei ole sinulle vain pilvipalvelu, vaan se on ammattitaitosi alusta. Olet vastuussa luomaan ja hallitsemaan data-arkkitehtuureja, jotka mahdollistavat datan sulavan liikkumisen ja tarjoavat voimakkaan pohjan päätöksenteolle. Työskentelet tiiviisti asiakkaiden ja kumppaneiden kanssa, tarjoten heille näkemyksiä siitä, miten Azuren teknologiat ja parhaat käytännöt voivat kääntää dataa strategiseksi kilpailueduksi.Työtä ei kuitenkaan tarvitse tehdä yksin, vaan olet osa Cloud1-tiimiä, joka on täynnä kokeneita ammattilaisia ja lupaavia kykyjä. Rakennatte yhdessä älykkäitä ratkaisuja, jotka ovat sekä teknisesti kehittyneitä että liiketoiminnallisesti kriittisiä. Cloud1 ei ole vain työpaikka, se on ammatillinen yhteisö, joka tukee sinua ammatillisesti ja tarjoaa innostavan ympäristön oppia uutta ja saavuttaa yhdessä asetetut tavoitteet.TarjoammeTarjoamme ammattilaisille sopivan kokonaispaketin, johon sisältyvät taloudellisten etujen lisäksi mahdollisuus osallistua yrityksemme menestykseen osakkaana. Panostamme myös terveyteesi ja hyvinvointiisi kattavien työterveyspalveluiden ja vakuutusten kautta.

You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: You wonder what Wolt Market is? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform. Wolt Market delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.Our humble expectationsAbout the role and our humble expectations:It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics.

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: Finance and Fintech is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.About The Role And Our Humble ExpectationsI. It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.II. What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.III. Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.IV. What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.V. Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.Next StepsOur offering to you Lots of room to build the direction of analytics at Wolt. Our Product and Operations organizations will be growing too, meaning that you have the chance to build the team around you and shape the way the organization works with data and analytics. You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You have the chance to decide the ways of working - a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the locations above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup. In addition to our country-specific benefits, our compensation package includes a monthly salary based on your expertise and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie. 🚀You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.

The NORDIC INVESTMENT BANK (NIB) offers you the chance to do banking that makes a difference. The projects that we finance benefit the environment and improve productivity in the Nordic-Baltic region. We are an International Financial Institution owned by the eight Nordic and Baltic countries, and we offer you the possibility to work with experts from around the world. The challenges you will face working at NIB are unique and will provide you with valuable experiences. We value diversity and we are a close network of some 230 professionals located in the heart of Helsinki. The atmosphere is international and our official working language is English.We are looking for a SENIOR RISK MANAGER - Model Validation Lead to join the Risk Management Office in Helsinki.As financial institutions heavily rely on models, it is imperative for them to understand and manage the risks surrounding the models that drive decision-making. At NIB, the change (in 2020) to a risk-based comprehensive framework for capital and liquidity management further highlighted the need for rigorous management of the risks related to models.Model risk is the potential loss an institution may incur as a consequence of decisions that are principally based on the output of models, due to errors in the development, implementation or use of such models.NIB is recruiting to lead the model validation activities. The key objectives of this function are to 1) help assure decision-makers that key models are reliable, “fit-for-purpose”, perform adequately and comply with internal policies and external expectations, 2) increase stakeholder understanding of model limitations and weaknesses, and 3) contribute to ongoing model improvements.Your role Maintain the model risk management framework (Policy and Guidelines)Maintain the model inventory and manage the model validation programmeDesign and oversee the model performance monitoring and control processRemediate/address findings from the third line of defense (Internal Audit)Assist and educate model owners and users to improve model diligence, including promoting and enforcing sound model development practices and documentation standardsDevelop and manage indicators used to monitor and report on model risksAssist to integrate model risk into operational risk (and non-financial risk) reportingMonitor regulatory developments and best practices for model risk managementIssue recommendations (e.g. mitigating actions) to model owners and users following validation exercises and/or documented observationsContribute thought leadership on model risk and data governance with key stakeholders
Your colleaguesYou will be working in the Risk Management Office in Helsinki. We serve as a cross-functional hub, overseeing risk management processes - like the ICAAP - and areas which cut across (and complement) the individual risk categories (credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks) to generate a holistic view of risks.We ensure that NIB has a robust, effective overall risk management governance and framework covering all material risks. We also lead the integration of increasingly important non-financial sources of risk into the risk management mainstream, acting in the second line of defense role when it comes to macro-financial (systemic) risk, business & strategic risk, climate risk (and ESG), and model risk.As a Senior Risk Manager, you would lead the model validation activities. As part of your duties, you would have frequent interaction with model owners, stewards, and users and provide direct input to key decision-making bodies.

"Director of AI - Enhanced Software Development, Trilogy (Remote) - $400,000/year USD","Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Software DevelopmentDocumentation, Enterprise Solution Design, Establishing Processes, Generative AI, New Product Rollout, Screening, and Technical Solution Design",Remote,Full-time,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3751413595,Crossover,https://www.linkedin.com/company/crossover/life,"Crossover  · Tuusula, Uusimaa, Finland Reposted  9 hours ago  · 1 applicant",Reposted  9 hours ago,0,"
Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you’ll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products: Crossover - an AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants per year to find the top 1% of global remote talent.gt.school - an online education platform that uses advanced data collection, algorithms, and AI-generated content to empower students to learn at their own pace.Data-driven Sales - an initiative that leverages data and AI algorithms to streamline the sales process across a portfolio of over 100 software products.
We're on the brink of an exhilarating journey with generative AI, and we want you to be a part of it. If you're eager to pioneer this transformation and play a pivotal role in the AI-driven future of software development, Trilogy is the place for you.What You Will Be Doing Proposing and conducting experiments with generative AI to enhance engineering processes, including problem decomposition, solution design, code generation, and advanced troubleshooting.Documenting best practices and techniques in playbooks and guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.Using AI tools and techniques to develop and roll out actual features and products.Adopting, testing, and aggressively integrating new technologies, and standardizing a tech stack that genuinely boosts productivity.
What You Won’t Be Doing Developing completely new AI models - we are focusing our attention on reusing and/or finetuning existing models instead. Engaging in academic exercises without tangible outcomes or failing to deliver features and products.Getting stuck on a stagnant tech stack that neither changes nor innovates.
