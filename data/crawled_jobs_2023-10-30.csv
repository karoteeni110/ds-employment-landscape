Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Aikasi jakautuu noin 50/50 sisäisen kehityksen ja asiakasprojektien välillä.Tehtävä on ns. full-stack data rooli, jossa työskentelet sekä tietovarastojen että raportoinnin kehityksen parissa. Päivittäiseen työhösi kuuluu esimerkiksi tietomallinnusta, ETL-putkien rakentamista ja datan visualisointia. Pääset työskentelemään läheisesti suoraan asiakkaidemme kanssa asiakkaan tarpeiden kartoittamisesta ratkaisujen luomiseen ja esittelyyn, eikä asiakasprojekteja ei tarvitse tehdä yksin, sillä projektit toteutuvat omalla tiimillämme. Koska työskentelemme pitkissä asiakassuhteissa, pääset myös näkemään työsi konkreettiset hyödyt.“Mielestäni Insta erottuu joukosta siinä, että meiltä löytyy osaamista alkaen automaatiojärjestelmistä aina älykkäisiin pilviratkaisuihin ja tietoturvaan. Tämä antaa parhaat lähtökohdat datan hyödyntämiseen ja kokonaisvaltaisten ratkaisuiden tarjoamiseen.”Business Intelligence Architect Iiro Pihlajaniemi Työsi on vaihtelevaa, sillä pääset työskentelemään erilaisissa ympäristöissä ja eri sidosryhmiemme kanssa.

We are also interested in how altered plant-microbe associations translate to soil ecosystem processes such as decomposition, microbial community growth and carbon use efficiency. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios. The selected candidate is expected to take part in designing their project and take full responsibility for its’ implementation from data collection to presentation of results in both scientific journals and conferences. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.

 A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in ecological statistics We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plants communities. We will use a complementary analytical toolbox to identify how sensitive contemporary plant and microbial community structure and species interactions are to past biodiversity changes and environmental change. Relevant analytical approaches may include, but are not restricted to, Joint Species Distribution Model approaches (.g. HMSC; Sallinen et al. 2020), Random Markov Fields models (Norberg et al. 2023), and network analyses. The Ecological Memory framework can be used to quantify how much past plant biodiversity and environmental conditions affect contemporary plant-microbe associations and ecosystem functioning.

"Director of AI - Enhanced Software Development, Trilogy (Remote) - $400,000/year USD","Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Software DevelopmentDocumentation, Enterprise Solution Design, Establishing Processes, Generative AI, New Product Rollout, Screening, and Technical Solution Design",Remote,Full-time,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3745943563,Crossover,https://www.linkedin.com/company/crossover/life,"Crossover  · Tuusula, Uusimaa, Finland Reposted  7 hours ago  · 2 applicants",Reposted  7 hours ago,0,"
Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you’ll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products: Crossover - an AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants per year to find the top 1% of global remote talent.gt.school - an online education platform that uses advanced data collection, algorithms, and AI-generated content to empower students to learn at their own pace.Data-driven Sales - an initiative that leverages data and AI algorithms to streamline the sales process across a portfolio of over 100 software products.
We're on the brink of an exhilarating journey with generative AI, and we want you to be a part of it. If you're eager to pioneer this transformation and play a pivotal role in the AI-driven future of software development, Trilogy is the place for you.What You Will Be Doing Proposing and conducting experiments with generative AI to enhance engineering processes, including problem decomposition, solution design, code generation, and advanced troubleshooting.Documenting best practices and techniques in playbooks and guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.Using AI tools and techniques to develop and roll out actual features and products.Adopting, testing, and aggressively integrating new technologies, and standardizing a tech stack that genuinely boosts productivity.
What You Won’t Be Doing Developing completely new AI models - we are focusing our attention on reusing and/or finetuning existing models instead. Engaging in academic exercises without tangible outcomes or failing to deliver features and products.Getting stuck on a stagnant tech stack that neither changes nor innovates.
