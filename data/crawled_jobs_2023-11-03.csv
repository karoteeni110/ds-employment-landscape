Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitoratatrainee-ohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme

Oletko finanssijuridiikasta kiinnostunut tulevaisuuden tekijä? Haluatko kehittyä ja verkostoitua monipuolisessa ympäristössä Suomen isoimmalla finanssialan toimijalla?

Vahvistamme Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan -yksikköämme Helsingissä nyt juristi-traineella!



Harjoittelusi tulee keskittymään data- ja tietosuojajuridiikkaan eli tehtäväsi kytkeytyy EUn tietosuoja-asetuksen ja muun datasääntelyn käytännön soveltamiseen OP Ryhmän toiminnassa. Perehdyt lisäksi myös finanssialaa sekä digitaalista liiketoimintaa koskevaan sääntelyyn. Tulet tukemaan tehtävässä tietosuoja-asiantuntijoidemme sekä tietosuojan asiakaspalvelutiimin arkea sekä toimimaan erilaisissa henkilötietojen käsittelyyn liittyvissä selvittämis- ja ohjaustehtävissä. Kartoitat tietosuojaan liittyviä toimintatapojamme, raportoit niistä sekä koostat kehitysehdotuksia.



Sinulla on oikeustieteellinen korkeakoulututkinto tai olet vastaavien opintojesi loppuvaiheessa. Voit olla myös opintojen alkuvaiheessa, mikäli olet tukenut opintojasi tietosuojaan liittyvällä harjoittelulla. Tietosuojaan, data-asioihin tai digitaalisiin palveluihin liittyvä kokemus katsotaan eduksi. Myös selvityshankkeiden tekeminen ja raportointiosaaminen ovat iso plussa.

Tulet tekemään yhteistyötä monien sidosryhmien kanssa, joten toimit erilaisissa sosiaalisissa tilanteissa luontevasti ja rohkeasti. Työskentelemme pääasiassa suomeksi, mutta alan termistön ymmärtäminen myös englannin kielellä on tärkeää. Näet pienistä osasista koostuvat kokonaisuudet ja kykenet tekemään niin suullisia, kuin kirjallisiakin esityksiä. Työskentelytyylisi on itsenäinen ja olet tarvittaessa valmis tekemään nopeitakin päätöksiä.



Juristi-traineena toimit ryhmän Lakiasiat & Compliance –toiminnon Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan yksikössä, joka palvelee koko OP Ryhmää henkilötietoihin ja dataan liittyvissä oikeudellisissa kysymyksissä. OP Ryhmä tarjoaa yhden Suomen laajimmista tietosuoja- ja data-asioiden toimintakentistä. Toimimme monilla liiketoiminta-alueilla ja digitaalisen kehityksen kärjessä. Tämä on siis aidosti näköalapaikka.



Tehtävässä pääset näkemään, miten iso digitaalinen liiketoiminta vastaa sääntelyvaatimuksiin ja miten muutokset näkyvät kuluttajien arjessa. Tueksesi saat vahvan osaajajoukon, jonka kanssa pääset toiminnan keskiöön harjoittelemaan sääntelyvaatimusten käytännön soveltamista.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa yksikön päällikkö Hanna Lankinen, puh. 040 723 0053 (soittoajat 27.10. klo 12-13 ja 31.10. klo 9-10).

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet sekä teetetään huumausainetesti.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Position Description

Vuonna 1976 perustettu CGI on maailman ja Suomen suurimpia IT- ja liiketoimintakonsultoinnin palveluyhtiöitä – ja tuhansien erilaisten uratarinoiden talo. Lisätietoa www.cgi.fi.



Haluatko työskennellä kehittyvässä ympäristössä, jossa mielenkiintoiset ongelmanratkaisutilanteet ovat arkipäivää? Jos vastasit kyllä, paikkasi voisi olla tiimissämme!



Data Arkkitehdin tehtävässä voit olla esimerkiksi toteuttamassa asiakkaamme modernia tietovarastoa pilveen tai rakentamassa integraatioita. Kanssamme voit vaikuttaa oman työsi sisältöön, ja meille on tärkeää, että pääset työskentelemään ja kehittymään sinua kiinnostavien teknologioiden parissa. Työssäsi autat suomalaisia sosiaali- ja terveydenhuollon toimijoita sekä kuntasektoria kehittämään liiketoimintaansa datan avulla.



Digital Society -yksikkömme palvelee sosiaali- ja terveydenhuollon sekä kunta toimialojen asiakkaista. Tiimimme tuo yhteen tietojenkäsittelyn ja toimialojen substanssin parhaan osaamisen. Tiimin ydinosaamista ovat data-analytiikan ja tiedolla johtamisen asiantuntijapalvelut sekä konsultointipalvelut, jotka yhdistämme CGI:n laajaan tarjontaan mm. palvelumuotoilusta, tietoturvasta ja ohjelmistokehityksestä. Kun tiimimme asiantuntijat laittavat fiksut päänsä yhteen, osaamme esimerkiksi toimittaa modernin, pilvipalveluita hyödyntävän data-alustan niin hyvinvointialueiden tarpeisiin. Meillä jokaisen asiantuntijuudelle on oma paikkansa, kanssamme viihdyt varmasti!

Tuleva toimistosi voi olla millä tahansa Suomen toimipisteestämme. Jos kotitoimisto on enemmän mieleesi, sekin sopii meille. Joustavan hybridityön avulla haluamme mahdollistaa, että työsi ja vapaa-aikasi pysyvät tasapainossa.



Sinulla on jo kokemusta pilvipohjaisten datatyökalujen kanssa työskentelystä, erityisesti tietovarastoinnissa. Teemme paljon yhteistyötä sekä tiimin sisällä että asiakkaiden kanssa, joten toivomme sinulta hyviä vuorovaikutustaitoja, niin suomeksi kuin englanniksi. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme positiivista asennetta ja oma-aloitteisuutta. Toivoisimme sinulta osaamista seuraavista:



Tiimimme työskentelee muun muassa seuraavien teknologioiden parissa, ja eduksi katsomme, jos sinulta löytyy osaamista seuraavista:



Todennäköisesti sinulta löytyy etsimäämme osaamista, mikäli ainakin osa yllä mainituista on sinulle tuttuja (ja mieluisia) teknologioita ja pystyt hyödyntämään niitä tekemisessä täysimääräisesti ja kokonaisuuksien kannalta mielekkäällä tavalla.

Jos olet ongelmanratkaisija, jolla on intohimoinen suhtautuminen dataan, haluamme kuulla sinusta! Soittele rohkeasti Tuomakselle (yhteystiedot alla) niin keskustellaan yhdessä millaisia uramahdollisuuksia meillä voisi olla tarjolla.





Tarjoamme sinulle paitsi työn, jossa voit kehittyä haluamaasi suuntaan, myös mahdollisuuden omistaa yhtiön osakkeita. Koska yli 80 prosenttia henkilöstöstämme on myös omistajia, kutsumme henkilöstöämme membereiksi. Membereinä pääsemme nauttimaan CGI:n taloudellisesta menestyksestä ja rakentamaan toiveidemme mukaista yhtiötä.



Meitä on 3 700 ympäri Suomen ja meille on tärkeää, että jokainen meistä saa olla työpaikalla oma itsensä. Monimuotoiset tiimimme määrittelevät itse, millaiset joustavat työnteon tavat niille parhaiten sopivat. Meillä työ myös joustaa, kun elämäntilanne sitä vaatii.



Meille CGI:n membereille on tärkeää, että tuemme ja autamme aina toisiamme. Et ole koskaan yksin: tuhansista huippuasiantuntijoistamme löytyy aina joku, johon tukeutua. Ja tarjoamme tietysti myös laajan valikoiman henkilöstöetuja, jotka auttavat sinua voimaan paremmin.

HELSINKI

Haluatko päästä käsiksi Suomen mielenkiintoisimpaan dataan? Onko markkinoinnin vaikuttavuuden ja tuloksellisuuden analysointi ja kehittäminen lähellä sydäntäsi? Oletko digitaalisen analytiikan seniorosaaja ja hallitset myös SQL:n hyvin?





Data-analyytikkona työskentelet tärkeänä osana operatiivisia markkinoinnin bränditiimejämme. Työnkuvasi ytimeen kuuluu markkinoinnin kohderyhmien suunnittelu ja monikanavaisten kampanjoiden ja markkinointiohjelmien tuloksellisuuden mittaaminen ja raportointi. Analysoit jatkuvasti kampanja-, asiakas- ja myyntidataa ja tuotat data-analyysiin pohjautuvia suosituksia markkinointiviestinnän kehittämiseksi.

Työpaikkasi sijaitsee Ässäkeskuksessa Helsingin Vallilassa. Toistaiseksi toimimme joustavasti hybridimallilla toimisto- ja etätyötä sujuvasti yhdistäen.



Tässä roolissa menestyt omaamalla analyyttista otetta ja ongelmanratkaisukykyä. Olet sinut erilaisten tutkimus- ja datalähteiden analysoinnin kanssa, ja saat jäsennettyä tiedon helposti ymmärrettävään muotoon. Kykenet muodostamaan keräämäsi datan pohjalta merkityksellisiä johtopäätöksiä ja luomaan keskustelua, jotta tiimisi kykenee jatkuvasti kehittämään markkinoinnin vaikuttavuutta ja tehokkuutta. Matemaattisesta kyvykkyydestä, tilastotieteen osaamisesta ja kokemuksesta data-analyysista ja digianalytiikan tuottaman datan analysoinnista on tehtävässä hyötyä. Hallitset SQL-kielen hyvin ja omaat kokemusta datavisualisoinnin työkaluista kuten PowerBI:stä, joita käytät päivittäin osana työkalupakkiasi.

Parhaan taustan tähän tehtävään antaa alan ylempi korkeakoulututkinto ja kokemus toimimisesta vastaavissa tehtävissä markkinoinnin analytiikan tai konsultoinnin parissa. Tehtävässä menestyminen edellyttää myös sujuvaa suomen ja englannin kielen taitoa.

Uskomme, että viihdyt meillä, jos olet kehitysorientoitunut ja oppimishaluinen sekä työskentelyotteeltasi ratkaisukeskeinen ja aikaansaava. Pääset työssäsi liikkeelle silloinkin, kun asiat eivät ole yksiselitteisesti jäsenneltyjä, ja omaat hyvät vuorovaikutustaidot sekä halun puhaltaa tiimin kanssa yhteen hiileen.

Description

Are you passionate about data engineering and data architecture? Would you like to build solutions that create actual business value? At Nitor, we help our clients to succeed with data.



As a Senior Data Engineer at Nitor, your aim is to help our customers extract business value from data with a pragmatic approach, focusing on solving their challenges with the right tools. Your responsibilities might include creating data-intensive applications, automating and orchestrating data pipelines, and simplifying complex technical entities into more common-sense solutions.

Communication with the customer is crucial, and training our customer’s experts to use and maintain the provided solution is also an intriguing part of your job.

Our customer projects are typically challenging yet professionally rewarding. The projects provide an experienced Senior Data Engineer with the possibility to widely utilize and deepen their skill set. The duration of the projects usually ranges between one year and multiple years, depending on your preferences. Our data business unit Nitor Insight, established in 2018, is a tight-knit and startup-like community with an exceptionally high level of data know-how.









A set of benefits that makes a difference

In addition to meaningful projects and customized possibilities for professional development, we offer you a profound set of employee benefits. Nitor is built in a way that it can support your career development, sustainable work pace, and well-being.

Haemme Helsinkiin data-analyytikkoa osaksi Yrityspankin liiketoiminnassa automaattisesta päätöksenteosta, hinnoittelumalleista sekä edistyneestä data-analytiikasta vastaavaan yksikköömme. Tavoitteenamme on muuntaa liiketoimintaosaamisemme analytiikaksi, mallinnukseksi, koodiksi ja lopulta ratkaisuksi, joka tekee asiakkaidemme arjesta sujuvamman.

Data Analyst / Senior Data Analyst, OP Yrityspankki

Toimessa vastaat Yrityspankin luottoriskiraportoinnin ja -analysoinnin kehittämisestä sekä luottoriskiposition valvonnasta. Toimit data-analytiikan asiantuntijana digitalisaatiota edistävissä strategisissa investoinneissa ja projekteissa sekä tarvittaessa tarjoat osaamistasi myös vastuualueesi ulkopuolella.

Vaikutat rahoitusliiketoiminnan tuloksellisuuteen luottoriskinoton laatua parantamalla. Pääset luomaan uutta, kehittämään liiketoimintaa ja näkemään oman työsi lopputuloksen konkreettisesti.



Tässä tehtävässä pääset osaksi kymmenen alansa huippuosaajan ydintiimiä, jossa teemme töitä tosissaan mutta hyvällä huumorintajulla ja yhteishengellä. Meillä pääset haastamaan itseäsi, oppimaan ja työskentelemään sopivan itsenäisellä otteella. Tiimillä on vetäjä, jolle esihenkilötyössä on tärkeää, että työnteossa on selkeät tavoitteet sekä riittävä vapaus ja itsenäisyys valita keinot niiden saavuttamiseen. Tiimiläisemme kuvailevat porukkaamme esimerkiksi sanoilla ”Timanttinen porukka, jossa aina voi luottaa muihin” sekä ”Tiimin kanssa työnjako ja osaaminen tukee ja auttaa omassa työssä.”

Teemme yhteistyötä Yrityspankin sisällä niin Suomessa kuin Baltiassa sekä laajasti sisäisten sidosryhmien kanssa. Arvostamme jokaisen antamaa työpanosta ja tuemme toisiamme arjen haasteissa. Vastaamme automaattisten luottopäätös-, maksukyky- ja hinnoittelulogiikoiden kehityksestä koko pankkitoiminnassa sekä luottoriskiraportoinnin ja -analysoinnin kehittämisestä Yrityspankissa.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja. Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilöstörahasto sekä henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut.

Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.



Menestyäksesi tehtävässä sytyt uuden luomisesta ja tunnistat sen potentiaalin liiketoiminnan kehittämisessä. Sinulla on kyky yhdistää teoriaa ja käytäntöä liiketoimintaa edistävällä tavalla. Pidät työstä, jossa pääset ratkomaan ja kehittämään asioita itsenäisellä otteella tukenasi huippuosaava tiimi. Kykenet tunnistamaan liiketoiminnan tulosta ja riskiasemaa parantavia kehityskohteita säilyttäen fokuksen laadukkaassa datassa.

Sinulla on kokemusta kvantitatiivisesta analysoinnista sekä oivaltavien visualisointien toteuttamisesta. Haluat hyödyntää osaamistasi liiketoiminnan kehittämisessä. Olet kokenut raportoinnin ja analytiikan toteuttaja, joka omaa aikaisempaa kokemusta modernien automatisoitujen itsepalveluanalytiikkaratkaisujen rakentamisesta tietolähteeltä lopputuotteeksi. Työssäsi käytät esimerkiksi seuraavia työvälineitä tai ohjelmointikieliä Tableau, Power BI, Alteryx, SQL, Python ja R.

Teknisen osaamisen arvostamme pankkiliiketoiminnan liiketoiminta- ja palvelumallien, rahoitusprosessin sekä riskienhallinnan yleisten periaatteiden tuntemista. Suomen kielen lisäksi hallitset kirjallisen ja suullisen kommunikoinnin englanniksi.

Haemme dataosaajaa pankkitoiminnan datan kehitysprojekti- ja/tai tuotantotehtäviin. Tehtävässä olet osana tiivistä kehitys- tai ylläpidon asiantuntijatiimiä, jonka työnä on rakentaa ja ylläpitää dataputkia sekä kehittää tietovarastointia pankkien viranomaisraportointiin ja riskienhallintaan. Vahvana kasvuyhtiönä toteutamme ja käyttöönotamme pankkialan taloudellisen riskienhallinnan ja viranomaisraportoinnin uusimpia ja tehokkaimpia data- ja raportointiratkaisuja.

Tehtävässä menestymisen kannalta olennaisia ominaisuuksia ovat SQL-osaaminen, kiinnostus laajojen kokonaisuuksien hallintaan ja ongelmanratkaisuun sekä sitoutuminen jatkuvaan prosessiin, jossa dataputkia kehitetään ja automatisoidaan. Myös Azure-pilviympäristön tunteminen asettaa sinut etulyöntiasemaan.

Työn ytimen muodostavat datavirran end-to-end hallinnointi ja kehittäminen lähde(pankki)järjestelmistä raportointiin sekä datan jalostaminen käyttökelpoiseen muotoon.

Käsiteltävä rahoitusalan data liittyy mm. pankkien laina-, talletus ja muihin rahoitusinstrumentteihin ja datan käyttökohteet liittyvät pääosin pankkien riskienhallintaan ja viranomaisraportointiin, joten kiinnostus finanssialaa kohtaan ja ymmärrys pankkiliiketoiminnasta katsotaan eduksi.

Tarkka tehtäväsi muotoutuu oman osaamisesi perusteella - tiedonhallinnan ja tietovarastoinnin syväosaajana pääset aiheen haastavien kehitystehtävien pariin ja Azure-osaajana pääset toteuttamaan tietovarastointia myös pilvessä.





Hakijan ei odoteta täyttävän jokaista edellä mainittua kohtaa. Keskeisimmät tehtävissäsi tarvittavat taidot ovat tietovarastointiin liittyvä SQL-osaaminen, kyky itsenäiseen ongelmanratkontaan ja hyvät tiimityöskentelytaidot.

Työskentelytyyliltäsi olet tarkka ja oma-aloitteinen sekä olet valmis omaksumaan nopeasti uusia asioita. Olet halukas ottamaan vastuuta ja tekemään omia ratkaisuja. Suomen kielen lisäksi odotamme sujuvaa suullista ja kirjallista englannin kielen taitoa.



Yli 140 ALMilaisesta koostuva työyhteisömme on rento ja yhteisöllinen. Hyvä yhteishenki valuu myös vapaalle: esimerkkejä viimeaikaisista työyhteisön järjestämistä aktiviteeteista ovat lautapeli-illat, tiimien kokoaminen Helsinki City Runiin ja Tough Vikingiin, sekä karting-iltama. Myös Discord-kanavamme ja esports-kulttuurimme on aktiivinen. Jos sinulle sopivaa vapaa-ajan tekemistä meiltä ei vielä löydy, otamme uudet ideat ilolla vastaan! Työilmapiirissämme korostuu luottamus, vapaus ja rentous. Sinulle tämä näkyy vapautena vaikuttaa oman työsi lisäksi myös laajemmin tapoihimme tehdä asioita. Meillä tehdään töitä tosissaan, mutta ei totisena.



Olemme velaton ja kannattava yritys, eli lyhyesti sanottuna luotettava työnantaja. Työnantajana olemme myös reilu ja joustava: emme diggaile ylimääräistä byrokratiaa. Meille asiakkaat ja työntekijät ovat aina ykkössijalla, koska molempia tarvitaan menestyksekkään liiketoimintamme jatkamiseen myös tulevaisuudessa. Meillä on helppoa viihtyä, ja jotain meistä työnantajana kertoo se, että moni muualle lähteneistä ALMilaisista on halunnut palata pian takaisin.

Mikäli nykyinen, entiseen maailmaan palaamaan hamuava legacy-työnantajasi on pakottanut sinut istumaan taas toimistolle, hae meille. Me maksamme palkkaa aikaansaannostesi perusteella riippumatta siitä, missä ne ovat fyysisesti syntyneet. Tarjoamme sinulle mahdollisuuden työskennellä paikkariippumattomasti haluamastasi sijainnista, mutta Helsingin, Jyväskylän, Oulun ja Tukholman toimistomme ovat luonnollisesti käytettävissäsi.

Työsuhde-etuina tarjoamme sinulle kattavat työterveys- ja hammashuoltopalvelut, kulttuuri- ja liikuntaedut sekä laajan vakuutuspaketin, joka sisältää mm. sairaskulu- ja vapaa-ajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Panostamme osaamisen kehittämiseen ja siksi tarjoammekin työntekijöillemme laajat koulutusmahdollisuudet, mm. Coursera-verkkokurssialustan ja korvauksen Azure-sertifikaattien suorittamisesta.



Työt alkavat sopimuksen mukaan. Olemme kiinnostuneista urallaan eri vaiheissa olevista ihmisistä: palkkaus tähän tehtävään on alkaenkuukaudessa, kuukausipalkasta sovitaan riippuen aiemmasta kokemuksestasi.

Olet asiakkaan kumppani data-alustojen, integraatioiden ja datan hyödyntämisen käyttötapausten toteuttamisessa, etkä pelkää osallistua hands-on -tekemiseen projekteissa.

Omaat liiketoimintaymmärrystä ja intohimoa datan hyödyntämistä kohtaan. Olemme asiakkaan kumppani ensisijaisesti teknologiassa, mutta ehdottoman olennaista on, että teknologialla pyritään parantamaan asiakkaan yritystoimintaa.

Olemme Azure-teknologian asiantuntijoita, joten data-arkkitehdin roolissa odotamme, että sinulta löytyy käytännön kokemusta eri Azuren datapalveluista kuten


Näiden lisäksi ymmärrät Azure -ympäristön kehittämistä laajemmin, jotta kykenet reagoimaan oman erikoisosaamisalueesi ohella asiakkaan Azure-tarpeisiin mm. tunnistamalla mahdollisuuksia, joissa työkaverisi voi omalla erityisosaamisalueellaan auttaa asiakasta.


Meillä tienaat tässä roolissa omaan kokemustasoon perustuen 5000 - 6500 €/kk. Lisäksi haluamme kaikki työntekijämme osaksi kasvuamme, ja seuraaville aloittajille tarjoamme houkuttelevan tavan päästä mukaan osakkuuteen. Me pidämme Mallowilaisista huolta, ja siksi meillä onkin erittäin kattavat työterveyspalvelut sekä palkan päälle maksettavat lounas-, liikunta- ja hierontaedut. Työskentelyvälineet kuten koneet ja puhelimet valitset omien mieltymyksiesi mukaan. Meillä saat myös netti- ja matkapuhelinliittymät Mallowin puolesta. Ja ehkä tärkein viimeisimpänä: ammatillisen osaamisen kehittymistä tuemme henkilökohtaisen kehityssuunnitelman avulla ja kokenut tiimimme tukee kasvuasi kohti ammatillisia päämääriäsi!


Olemme kotimainen Microsoft Azure -asiantuntijapalveluihin keskittyvä yritys ja autamme Azure-alustan parhaiden käytäntöjen suunnittelussa, hallinnointimallien rakentamisessa, sekä konkreettisessa sovellusten modernisoinnissa tai pilveen siirrossa. Asiantuntijamme ovat toimineet Azuren parissa sen alkumetreiltä saakka, ja taustamme on niin Microsoftilta kuin kotimaisistapilviasiantuntijayhtiöistä. Olemme osa Reaktorin Fusion Ecosystemiä ja tavoitteenammeon nostaa koko ekosysteemin kyvykkyyttä palvella asiakkaita Azure-teknologian ympärillä. Emme toimi yksin, vaan voimme hyödyntää kaikkia ekosysteemin partneriyrityksiä projekteissamme.

Toimimme hankkeissa advisorina, arkkitehtina tai toimitamme ratkaisun vaatimaa konsultointia tai paketoituja palveluja. Toimimme usein asiakkaan aisaparina, mutta läheisessä yhteistyössä asiakkaan sovellus- tai palvelutoimittajien kanssa.

We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

About the Team

The Merchant Analytics Team at Wolt managed by Ayush focuses on solving merchant related challenges and is tasked with unlocking insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations which drive the success of merchants at Wolt.

Data Scientists at Wolt work to uncover insights and turn them into relevant recommendations, driving decisions for the entire organization. On the Merchant team we are focused on ramping up the merchant selection and finding opportunities to help merchants grow their business and be successful on Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects which can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

Our team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and BI Developers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.



As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect marketplace growth, we're looking for someone like you.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader, Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



You wonder whatis? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform.delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.







What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

We are looking for a Release Engineer to join to new Saas platform & Operations team in the Core Banking System tribe. The position is based in Helsinki but our remote work practices in Finland area are flexible.

We are currently enabling a gradual transformation of Retail and Corporate Banking segments in OP Financial Group. Transformation is enabled by shared core banking system and other system upgrades. As the name suggest, Core Banking System tribe is responsible of OP's new core banking system and successful transformation as a whole. We´re now fitting this new system into OP's technology environment. For this reason, we are now seeking a Release Engineer to manage release process in Core Banking System area.



As a Release Engineer, you are responsible of ensuring smooth deployment of releases (on SaaS environment) including total ownership of release content. Together with the team and other stakeholders (both onsite and offshore) you are planning and describing the content of new releases, planning and resourcing deployment, monitoring pre-production environment, following implementation, handling post-deployment defects and planning corrective actions. You are also driving the future software development and release pipeline methods. By identifying dependencies, possible problems and risks you maximize the safety of uninterrupted production. You are succeeding in your role, when all the dependencies and integrations are considered and there are no reliability concerns during the launches.

Since we are working on a very large-scale transformation process, your work as a Release Engineer will be very meaningful. You get to focus on launching a new environment, which has several different dependencies and has complex architecture around it. This transformation is in the heart of our banking business and services we are providing to our customers. One could really say we are doing something big here! For this reason, we are hoping to find someone who wants to improve existing processes and make them smoother in the future.

We strive to automate releases as much as possible. You are involved in the development of release automation in your service area. You are taking steps to remove dependencies and make releases more agile. Depending on your previous experience and your interest, you also have the opportunity to take the lead as our team’s Agile Master.



You have experience in similar tasks, and you have worked for example in release management, testing or as a technical project manager. You have a good understanding of SaaS environments, basic knowledge of data management tools, version control tools and methods as well as installation and test automation. You have experience with service management processes. You are used to using agile software development methods (Agile, DevOps) and most used tools (Jira, ServiceNow).

You have excellent collaboration and networking skills, and you know how to lead change and involve stakeholders. Even under a small pressure, you can take things forward in a solution-oriented way. The actual installations are done by our partners, so it helps a lot if you have experience in vendor management. In work-related matters you communicate fluently in English. Finnish skills are an advantage, but not mandatory.



It wouldn’t be fair if we had nothing to offer you. We have a wide range of staff benefits including a personnel fund and special terms for employee banking, insurance, and loan services. We offer comprehensive occupational health care, extensive medical treatment expenses insurance and a full-time group accident insurance policy. We invest in wellbeing at work by encouraging a good work-life balance, providing flexibility in your daily life, and offering lunch, sport and cultural benefits and opportunities for affordable holidays in OP timeshares.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called “70-20-10” model in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great – we can’t wait to hear from you! The application period is open until 15.11.2023, so now it is your time to shine! Do you have some questions related to the role in your mind? Tiina Heikkinen (Competence Lead, p. +358452293040) is happy to answer to your questions on 7.11. at 10-11 and on 14.11. at 12-13.

In the financial sector, our business is founded on trust and accountability, which is why the successful candidate will be checked for credit history, corporate connections, security clearance and must take a drug test.

Equality and diversity are highly valued at OP Financial Group. We welcome job applications from people of all kinds, regardless of their gender identity or age, or the culture or minority group with which they identify.

To achieve this goal, Newtrax integrates the latest Internet-of-Things and Artificial Intelligence technologies to monitor and provide insights on underground operations, including people, machines and the environment.

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you’re interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.





What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position you can turn to Group Talent Acquisition Partner / Analytics, Michal Szafraniec at michal.szafraniec@wolt.com

We’ve brought top talents from (literally) all over the world who focus relentlessly on building products which utilize ML and AI as their main edge. We know that when you infuse ML and technology, you move from good to great and that is our mission. Our Data Science managers are action driven leaders that can form vivid vision and successfully direct their people to execute it while being strongly rooted in the details and practice.

As a Data Science Manager, you will:

You are a developer of people. You love leading diverse teams of professionals with both qualitative and quantitative backgrounds using data-driven and insights-led approaches to respond quickly in a dynamic, competitive, and fast changing industry.

Tackle complex problems in the online travel and ecommerce space using a range of ML and data analysis methods. Use our huge data repositories to push our business metrics to their bounds, directly and indirectly. Foster a culture that constantly raises the bar for us and others and supports the freedom to explore and innovate.

Can we detect causation between metrics and bookings? How can automatically answer our users’ questions? How do we tune our AB testing platform to ensure we aren’t optimizing noise? How do we measure experiment success to properly trade off type I and II errors? What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it? How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack. You will be impacting every aspect of the business and it will require various techniques, from diving deep into data with SQL and Big Data tools, all the way to deploying modern machine learning models.

. Work directly with the heads of the business departments and the product management team. Influence them with compelling product ideas based on data insights that can move the dial on our business.





We welcome both local and international applications for this role. Full visa sponsorship and relocation assistance available for eligible candidates.

Job Description

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - Pricing and AdTech. This advert is focused on the Pricing domain, but if you’re interested in AdTech, please check this job advert.


The Consumer Pricing Data Science team is committed to consumer-first pricing that's fair, transparent, and compliant. We create innovative pricing solutions that offer clear value for our consumers. We collaborate cross-functionally to achieve both short-term and long-term business goals. Our team of Data Scientists and partners closely with Product, Engineering, Strategy & Operations, conducting experiments, advanced analytics, and operational reporting to enhance our consumer pricing strategies.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect Pricing, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Yrityksen kuvaus

Cubiq Analytics on analytiikkatalo, jossa alan parhaat osaajat haluavat olla töissä. Tehtävämme on toteuttaa suomalaisissa organisaatioissa ennennäkemättömiä läpimurtoja datan avulla.





Onko voima kanssasi? Hyvä! Etsimme tiimiimme jo kokemusta kerryttänyttä Senior Power BI -konsulttia. Oletko sinä etsimämme vahva osaaja?

Tehtävänäsi on kehittää asiakkaillemme pilvipohjaisia analytiikkaratkaisuja Power BI:n avulla. Valomiekkoja emme tällä kertaa tarvitse, mutta Power BI:n tulisi olla hyvin hyppysissäsi. Haemmekin tiimiimme jo kokemusta kerryttänyttä osaajaa, joka hallitsee datan visualisoinnin lisäksi myös sen mallinnuksen. Senior konsulttina olet oman alasi asiantuntija ja jaat osaamistasi mielelläsi niin Cubiqin sisällä kuin asiakastöissäsi: otteesi on sparraava ja tuot aktiivisesti uusia ideoita esiin.

Power BI -tekemisemme kasvaa kohisten, mutta talostamme löytyy jo valmiiksi muita Power BI -osaajia, eikä asioita tarvitse pähkäillä ja pallotella koskaan yksin. Cubiqille tullessasi tuletkin osaksi yhteisöä. Meillä töitä tehdään vahvasti tiimeissä, ja asiakkuuden koosta riippuen tiimissäsi on monesti myös Data Engineerejä ja/tai web-devaajia. Asiakkaamme ovat suuria ja keskisuuria suomalaisia yrityksiä ja julkishallinnon organisaatioita, mikä takaa mielekkäät projektit ja oman osaamisen kehittymisen. Emme ole toimialasidonnaisia, joten asiakkaamme ja toimeksiantomme vaihtelevat laidasta laitaan. Pääsetkin laajentamaan ymmärrystäsi datan ja analytiikan arvoketjun valjastamisesta organisaation tarpeisiin hyvin monipuolisesti.

Rekrytointiprosessin aikana kartoitamme osaamistasi ja intohimoasi analytiikkaa kohtaan, jotta olisimme paras mahdollinen match toisillemme. Meillä ei ole turhaa byrokratiaa, joten rakennamme roolisi ja urapolkusi näiden keskustelujen ja kiinnostuksenkohteidesi pohjalta.












Olemme osa globaalin insinööri-, suunnittelu- ja konsultointiyritys AFRYn Management Consulting -liiketoimintayksikköä. Meillä pääset osaksi energistä ja osallistavaa yhteisöä, jossa on loistava tekemisen meininki ja työtäsi arvostetaan. Saat vaikuttaa aidosti asioihin ja luotsata omia visioitasi eteenpäin. Vapauden ja vastuun lisäksi takaamme joustavan työympäristön sekä kilpailukykyiset edut. Toimistomme sijaitsevat Helsingissä, Lahdessa, Tampereella ja Turussa.

Mitä mieltä töistään ja Cubiqista on meillä Power BI:llä päivittäin ratkaisuja tekevä Senior konsultti Johanna?

“Cubiqilla työskentelyssä parasta on työkaverit sekä vaihtelevat projektit. Monipuolisten työtehtävien ansiosta pääsen kehittämään omaa osaamistani, sillä asiakkaiden tarpeet ja ympäristöt ovat erilaisia. Välillä rakennan talouden Power BI -sovellusta ja seuraavana päivänä kehitän asiakkaan Azure-ympäristöä. Omien taitojen syventyminen onkin takuuvarmaa, ja Cubiqilla on tullut opittua lyhyessä ajassa paljon!”

Job Description

As the Database Engineering Team Lead, you will play a crucial role in architecting, designing, and maintaining the core database infrastructure that powers our platform. You will lead a team of skilled Database and DevOps engineers and collaborate closely with feature engineering teams to ensure seamless integration of database solutions into our products. Your technical expertise in MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Kafka, coupled with your leadership skills, will drive the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of our database systems at Wolt.





📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.







The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Anna Pivovar (anna.pivovar@wolt.com).



Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

Job Description

We are looking for a Product Lead to join our Consumer Search team. The search team is responsible for enabling Wolt users to find all that they need, easily.

What does it mean in practice? We are on an exciting journey building the best search experience in the industry that delights our customers. Whether they are looking for pasta (whether from their favorite restaurant or from a grocery store nearby), an ethernet cable for the PS5 they just copped, or the trendiest organic shop in their city, we aim to make it easy to find it and to deliver it promptly to their doorstep. We want to make entire cities discoverable via Wolt’s search experience.

As a Product Lead, you will work with a cross-functional team of incredibly talented engineering, design, product and analytics humans in a high visibility role. You will be responsible for defining the roadmap and setting the vision for your team. This involves leading multiple projects and cross-team product initiatives across the entire product lifecycle, partnering with business and operations stakeholders as well as understanding our end-users better than anyone.

Your home base will be Wolt’s product management team but you will be working on a daily basis with the Consumer Search team but also with the business operations and country team, who are responsible for the global and local businesses. When it comes to career progression, this role has a fairly clear path to a more strategy-focused and leadership-oriented role (e.g. head of product) over time, as one delivers impact. We’ll let you in on a little secret: most of Wolt’s product people leads today have been promoted from within 🥳.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in,or, or you can work remotely anywhere in,,,, and. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.



You could come to this role from a multitude of different backgrounds, but ideally, you have





The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Elif Dilan Ayaz (elifdilan.ayaz@wolt.com).



Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Open source is our beating heart and it’s something that fuels our work and our culture. It’s where we began. It’s where we’ll always be. Our vision is to become the trusted open source data platform for everyone. We are a Cast of over 400 individuals (‘Crabs’) located across the globe. Why Crabs? Because we believe in thinking sideways. And right now, we’re looking for sideways-thinking engineers.

The Engineering team at Aiven lies at the core of our organization. This is a great opportunity to become an integral member of the team as a Staff Software Engineer (Platform). We look for engineers who can work around problems by finding new angles. Thinking sideways. You will have the opportunity to collaborate with world-class tech people solving the toughest problems, where almost every project you work on is more complex and technically challenging than the previous one. If you relish pushing your technical boundaries, come join us. Because if you can truly think sideways, you’ll never look back.



So, how do we become the trusted open source data platform for everyone? By listening closely to our customers and taking action to ensure they achieve their business goals. You see, the software we create is merely a means of delivering value. Our thinking is customer-first. That’s why our customers are at the front and center of all we do. And in the spirit of sideways thinking, we’re by their side as well. Actively helping them solve their challenges. Collaborating. Sharing. And innovating. In other words, it really isn’t just about who we are. It’s about who our customers are – and where they want to be.



We want individuals who can embody our values of ownership, courage, and openness.

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don’t falter – we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We’re always open to new ideas – from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on our cloud operations platform turning the best open source technologies into frustration-free cloud services. You’ll be part of a team working on the Aiven cloud platform, improving its scalability and reliability, implementing new features as well as extending our product portfolio of open source data technologies

What We're Looking For:

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.

Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.

This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.

Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you’ll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products:



We're on the brink of an exhilarating journey with generative AI, and we want you to be a part of it. If you're eager to pioneer this transformation and play a pivotal role in the AI-driven future of software development, Trilogy is the place for you.



















Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.

There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!



This is a full-time (40 hours per week), long-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover. The compensation level for this role is $200 USD/hour, which equates to $400,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly.

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

The online travel industry is an extremely dynamic and competitive space. We aim to deliver compelling designs that create a world-class customer experience. You will have a key role in defining the future of our products that reach millions of customers. Despite our size, we operate in a startup-like environment.

This is an amazing opportunity if you’re looking for an exciting adventure abroad while expanding your international research capabilities. You get a chance to live in one of the most beautiful and most visited cities in the world!





We’re obsessed with creating compelling experiences for our millions of customers, across our travel booking experiences. We want to make travel easy, and for everyone with an all-in-one shop experience on Agoda.

The Marketing Product Team is trying to bring users, directly or through paid channels, to Agoda, so that over time, when users think of travel, they think of Agoda first. The team is highly data-driven and focused on developing at-scale, measurable, marketing programs & features that improve the lifetime value of Agoda customers. With travel being an infrequently used product, this is far more challenging to do than in a regular e-commerce context. The role of research thus becomes increasingly important, to help us understand how users decide where to book, how we can become their default choice, and so on. Of course, as a highly data-driven company, all insights need to translate into compelling data, as our UX researchers partner with product managers and analysts.







You will own end-to-end planning, execution, analysis, and reporting of research projects, and you will need to consistently achieve research outputs required by the design team and product team for their pursuits and occasionally inform strategic decisions in Product approach or business domain direction:

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.


In Agoda’s Engineering department, we build the scalable and fault-tolerant systems. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: website, mobile apps, affiliate apis, inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, finance and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD, experimentation and advanced testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like React, Redux state management, Javascript, Kotlin, Scala, data technologies like Kafka, Aerospike and Big Data, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or innovating on the latest fintech idea or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of our Engineering team.


The Senior Engineering Manager role at Agoda is one of the most significant and challenging roles in Technology.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.



Engineering Manager Kristin Hybertsen is happy to provide information about the daily work and answer any questions you may have about the role. Kristin is best reached through Linkedin or email kristin.hybertsen(at)schibsted.com

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.



Engineering Manager Kristin Hybertsen is happy to provide information about the daily work and answer any questions you may have about the role. Kristin is best reached through Linkedin or email kristin.hybertsen(at)schibsted.com

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we’re interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

Are you excited about handling petabytes of data and building a world-class data platform? Then let’s talk!

Data that we collect plays a central role in how we make decisions and improve our games to serve our players the best way possible. Our data engineers therefore take great care in keeping the data correct, up to date and easily accessible. In this position you will be responsible for ensuring that our data platform and infrastructure are rock solid and follow modern best practices. You will be actively contributing to various data engineering areas and solving unique challenges arising from the massive scale.

In this role we value a versatile skill set ranging from strong software development background to devops experience to uncompromising attitude towards high data quality. We are aiming to strengthen our team with experts passionate about large scale deployments, real-time data collection and data governance. We also expect you to proactively advance our data tech stack and drive improvement discussions in collaboration with the rest of the team as well as with data engineers and analysts across the company.






Luring you in with glitter, glamour, and gems is not what we seek to do. We develop Supercell as an employer for you to do your best work and to call this the best experience in your professional life.

We want you to enjoy your time here fully, so we structure our compensation and benefits to serve this purpose. It starts with perceiving you as a human being, not a resource.


We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games – played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.


Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you're bringing along.
