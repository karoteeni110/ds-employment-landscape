We're looking for a Data Engineer to help us in our mission to spread joy through singing. In this role, you will build the data infrastructure that shapes Singa‚Äôs song catalog and overall product experience!

As Singa is going through a growth phase, rebuilding its analytics infrastructure is paramount. It‚Äôs a complex problem as Singa offers multi-platform products and has multiple revenue sources being processed natively on each platform and through external invoicing systems across several territories.

As the company grows, getting accurate product, sales, and marketing KPIs data becomes increasingly crucial. Hence, the candidate has a big opportunity to provide an outsized impact on the company's future.

If you're interested in leaving your mark on popular culture by utilizing your skills in data engineering, you've found the job for you!











Singing belongs to everyone, not just professionals and pop stars. It's something fundamental to us humans. That's why we invented Singa - a modern streaming service for karaoke accessible by anyone, anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

We're building the future of singing by doing the same for karaoke that Netflix did for movies and Spotify for music ‚Äî updating an entire industry. We are uniquely positioned to become the biggest brand in a global market representing a 15 billion dollar opportunity.



Let‚Äôs face it. Life without karaoke is boring. Luckily, Singa comes to the rescue at home and Singa-powered karaoke venues worldwide.

The Singa karaoke app gives consumers access to a massive library of high-quality karaoke songs on mobile, web browsers, and Smart TVs. You can sing alone, make it a party with friends, or find the nearest Singa-powered karaoke venue and hit the stage.

On the B2B side, Singa helps pubs, bars, and other nightlife venues grow revenues with professional karaoke, background music, and display advertising software. We have a rapidly growing network of over 1,000 venues in Europe and the USA.



In karaoke, everyone can be themselves; the same applies to Singa. It doesn‚Äôt matter how, where, or when you work as long as it gets done. Individual freedom is coupled with equal amounts of responsibility and ownership.

We are all different but united in our ambition to make an impact on pop culture and our shared mission of making the world sing. Not to mention a few karaoke parties here and there, free singing lessons, epic staff trips, and other related shenanigans to keep it all interesting.



Step 1: Recruitment call

Step 2: First Interview - 30-minute video call with engineering team members.

Step 3: A homework assignment (code review).

Step 4: Second Interview - 45-minute co-working session with our engineering team members and product managers. Remote or on location, depending on preference and restrictions.

Step 5: Founder interview - 30-minute interview with our CEO founder

Step 6: Offer letter and contract signing

Haku OP Ryhm√§n vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt k√§ynniss√§! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaaja monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehitt√§viin teht√§viin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme.

Innostutko datasta ja tahdot p√§√§st√§ hy√∂dynt√§m√§√§n tietoteknist√§ osaamistasi finanssialan ty√∂teht√§vien parissa?

Vahvistamme v√§hitt√§ispankin dataosaamista Helsingiss√§ nyt kahdella Data Analyst Traineella!

Data Analyst Trainee, V√§hitt√§ispankki (2 teht√§v√§√§)

Traineena teht√§v√§n√§si on avustaa OPn v√§hitt√§ispankin liiketoimintaraportoinnin kehitt√§misess√§. Etsit dataa ja tuotat analyyseja ja raportteja, jotka tukevat liiketoiminnan kehityst√§ ja vaikuttavat liiketoimintap√§√§t√∂ksiin.



Etsim√§mme trainee on ennen kaikkea kiinnostunut datan hy√∂dynt√§misest√§ pankkiliiketoiminnassa ja haluaa kehitt√§√§ osaamistaan t√§ll√§ alalla. H√§n kykenee analyyttiseen ajatteluun ja pit√§√§ numeroiden kanssa ty√∂skentelyst√§. Etsim√§mme henkil√∂ ei tyydy helppoon ratkaisuun vaan pyrkii ymm√§rt√§m√§√§n liiketoimintaa ja siihen liittyvi√§ haasteita syv√§llisesti.

Katsomme teht√§v√§n kannalta eduksi vahvat tietotekniset taidot sek√§ raportointity√∂kalujen ja ohjelmointikielten tuntemuksen (esim. Tableau, PowerBI, SQL, R, Python). Katsomme eduksi my√∂s tilastollisten menetelmien ja koneoppimismenetelmien tuntemuksen, kirjanpidon ja laskentatoimen tuntemuksen sek√§ kokemuksen ty√∂skentelyst√§ contact centerissa.

Ty√∂yhteis√∂ss√§ toimit oma-aloitteisesti, kuitenkin ymp√§rill√§si olevat ihmiset huomioon ottaen. Saatat hyvinkin olla hakemamme osaaja, jos ty√∂skentelytapasi on systemaattinen ja ratkaisukeskeinen. Kommunikointi- ja vuorovaikutustaitosi ovat erinomaiset ja verkostoituminen on sinulle luontevaa. Hallitset viestinn√§n niin suullisesti kuin s√§hk√∂isiss√§ kanavissa. Sinulla on matemaattistekninen korkeakoulutasoinen koulutus sek√§ sujuva suomen ja englannin kielen taito.



P√§√§set mukaan liiketoiminnan p√§ivitt√§iseen ty√∂skentelyyn ja auttamaan datan avulla asiantuntijoita heid√§n p√§ivitt√§isiss√§ p√§√§t√∂ksiss√§√§n. Lis√§ksi p√§√§set kehitt√§m√§√§n osaamistasi yhdess√§ parinkymmenen muun analyytikon kanssa, joiden teht√§v√§alueet poikkeavat omastasi, mutta joiden kanssa jaat ty√∂kaluja, dataa ja tietoa. Analyytikkokollegojen kanssa kehit√§t yhteist√§ datavarantoa ja prosesseja pyrkien varmistamaan, ett√§ yksi tieto on yhdess√§ paikassa.



Tarjoamme Data Analyst -traineelle mahdollisuuden jatkuvaan kehittymiseen yhdess√§ muiden v√§hitt√§ispankin liiketoiminnoissa ty√∂skentelevien analyytikoiden kanssa. Teht√§v√§ss√§ sinulle kehittyy ymm√§rryst√§ v√§hitt√§ispankin liiketoiminnasta sek√§ monipuolinen tekninen osaaminen modernissa, jatkuvasti kehittyv√§ss√§ analytiikkaymp√§rist√∂ss√§.

Meill√§ tulet ty√∂skentelem√§√§n arjen vaativien teht√§vien parissa ja sen lis√§ksi, ett√§ saat valtavan m√§√§r√§n ty√∂el√§m√§ntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, p√§√§set mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemisell√§si ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meill√§, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisess√§si ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenp√§in! Ty√∂llistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen ty√∂suhteeseen 1.3. ‚Äì 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000‚Ç¨ / kk.

Vastuullisen ty√∂n vastapainoksi pid√§mme huolen ty√∂hyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista ty√∂j√§rjestelyist√§. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ymp√§rist√∂n, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisl√§heisyys ja yhdess√§ menestyminen ovat keskeisi√§ arvoja.

Saat k√§ytt√∂√∂si monipuoliset henkil√∂st√∂etumme, johon kuuluvat henkil√∂kuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lis√§ksi tarjoamme my√∂s kattavan ty√∂terveyshuollon sek√§ t√§ysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Ty√∂ss√§jaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sek√§ tarjoamalla k√§ytt√∂√∂si lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sek√§ mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.







Jos sinulla on mieless√§ kysymyksi√§ teht√§v√§st√§ tai meill√§ ty√∂skentelyst√§, lis√§tietoja teht√§v√§st√§ antaa Head of CoE Markku Leskinen puh. 040 826 9119 (26.10. klo 15‚Äì16 ja 31.10. klo 9‚Äì10).

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lis√§√§ sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeist√§√§n 5.11.2023 menness√§ Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme k√§sittelem√§√§n hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-teht√§viimme ja l√§het√§ hakemuksesi meille jo t√§n√§√§n!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, mink√§ vuoksi teht√§v√§√§n valittavalta henkil√∂lt√§ tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet sek√§ teetet√§√§n huumausainetesti.

OP Ryhm√§ on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava ty√∂yhteis√∂. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkil√∂it√§ hakemaan meille t√∂ihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ik√§iset sek√§ kulttuuri- ja v√§hemmist√∂ryhm√§t.

We are looking for a Release Engineer to join our Mortgages and Housing Services tribe. Our tribe ensures that our personal customers get the secured loans to fulfil their dreams of a new home, car or studies. We make sure that the systems, technical side, and automation behind every given loan works smoothly, is developed in a right way. Also, an important note in this is taking into account the responsibility side, we need to get to know our client and make sure they carry the load of the given loan.

The position is based in Helsinki but our remote work practices in Finland area are flexible.


Your future team is called ‚ÄúCredit decision and quality‚Äù, and we focus strongly on the ESG and responsibility side of the loan giving process. Our customers know that we are not giving loans to just anybody, but we make sure that the people can carry the load of the loan, and that we know in which the loan is used. Our team‚Äôs main focus is on recognizing the risks and pricing behind every granted credit. Without this process, we wouldn‚Äôt be able (nor would be allowed) to give any credit/loans to our customers.

As a Release Engineer, you are responsible of ensuring smooth deployment of releases, including total ownership of release content. Together with the team and other stakeholders (both onsite and offshore) you are planning and describing the content of new releases, planning and resourcing deployment, monitoring pre-production environment, following implementation, handling post-deployment defects and planning corrective actions. You are also driving the future software development and release pipeline methods. By identifying dependencies, possible problems and risks you maximize the safety of uninterrupted production. You are succeeding in your role, when all the dependencies and integrations are considered and there are no reliability concerns during the launches.

Since we are working on very meaningful topic for our customers (without our work we wouldn‚Äôt be able to give out these loans), your work as a Release Engineer will also be very meaningful. Since we are basically granting credit 24/7, the expectation is that the system and automatization must work smoothly around the clock, around the year.


We are now looking for an experienced Release Engineer, spiced up with technical knowledge as well. We are listing below what kind of experience we are looking for


You have good collaboration and networking skills, and you know how to lead change and involve stakeholders. Even under a small pressure, you can take things forward in a solution-oriented way. The actual installations are done by our partners, so it helps a lot if you have experience in vendor management. In work-related matters you communicate fluently in English. Finnish skills are an advantage, but not mandatory.


It wouldn‚Äôt be fair if we had nothing to offer you. We have a wide range of staff benefits including a personnel fund and special terms for employee banking, insurance, and loan services. We offer comprehensive occupational health care, extensive medical treatment expenses insurance and a full-time group accident insurance policy. We invest in wellbeing at work by encouraging a good work-life balance, providing flexibility in your daily life, and offering lunch, sport and cultural benefits and opportunities for affordable holidays in OP timeshares.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called ‚Äú70-20-10‚Äù model in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.


Great ‚Äì we can‚Äôt wait to hear from you! The application period is open until 22.10.2023, so now it is your time to shine! Do you have some questions related to the role in your mind? Tiina Heikkinen (Competence Lead, p. +358452293040) is happy to answer to your questions on 11.10. at 13-14 and on 16.10. at 13-14.

In the financial sector, our business is founded on trust and accountability, which is why the successful candidate will be checked for credit history, corporate connections, security clearance and must take a drug test.

Job Description

We are looking for an experienced Backend Engineer to join our MarTech Engagement team! This team helps our operational marketing teams as well as other teams at Wolt succeed with platform services and data pipelines. The team had its inception with marketing as its scope, and they are still the most important stakeholder. However many other teams in the company use our services daily. We strive to make our stakeholders‚Äô lives easier and our whole marketing machine more effective by taking great care of the design of the systems and user experience of the tooling.

The team is highly technical due to the platform nature of the services we build and maintain. Some example projects that you can get excited about working on are Audience builder platform for targeting our users with offers, communication and different app behavior. Consents platform for handling and storing data about consents in a compliant and secure manner used by all of Wolt.

The team consists of 3 Backend Engineers and more disciplines such as Data Engineering will likely be introduced. There is an emerging Go community at Wolt and our team has been pioneering its use. On the backend we use Echo (Go) and Python (FastAPI). Our APIs are documented with OpenAPI or gRPC. Spark (Scala) and SQL are used for our data engineering. Our event engine is built with Kafka, Protobuf and Benthos (Go).

Depending on your interest you are free to contribute across the team‚Äôs whole stack. We‚Äôre obsessed with high-ownership teams at Wolt, which means you‚Äôll get to work in a culture of freedom and accountability.

Feel free to check our Wolt Tech Talks here.

New team members are welcome to either of our tech hubs located in Helsinki and Stockholm or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. You can read more about our remote setup here. üåç



You have solid experience designing, building and operating quality software services. As we usewe are looking for someone with at least several years of prior experience working with either, and a willingness to learn the other. Our services are running on K8s hosted in AWS, and use PostgreSQL and Redis as our data storage.

In addition to technical skills, we expect a willingness to take ownership beyond the obvious, motivation to learn new things together and to teach others, and a willingness to collaborate with different teams across the organization.

Experience with big data engineering would be highly appreciated, but not mandatory.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Severi Kausola (severi.kausola@wolt.com).

We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we‚Äôre looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader, Wolt‚Äôs fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one‚Äôs skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



You wonder whatis? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt‚Äôs well known delivery platform.delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you‚Äôll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.







What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who‚Äôs not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we‚Äôre looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You‚Äôll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

Description

Are you passionate about data engineering and data architecture? Would you like to build solutions that create actual business value? At Nitor, we help our clients to succeed with data.



As a Senior Data Engineer at Nitor, your aim is to help our customers extract business value from data with a pragmatic approach, focusing on solving their challenges with the right tools. Your responsibilities might include creating data-intensive applications, automating and orchestrating data pipelines, and simplifying complex technical entities into more common-sense solutions.

Communication with the customer is crucial, and training our customer‚Äôs experts to use and maintain the provided solution is also an intriguing part of your job.

Our customer projects are typically challenging yet professionally rewarding. The projects provide an experienced Senior Data Engineer with the possibility to widely utilize and deepen their skill set. The duration of the projects usually ranges between one year and multiple years, depending on your preferences. Our data business unit Nitor Insight, established in 2018, is a tight-knit and startup-like community with an exceptionally high level of data know-how.









A set of benefits that makes a difference

In addition to meaningful projects and customized possibilities for professional development, we offer you a profound set of employee benefits. Nitor is built in a way that it can support your career development, sustainable work pace, and well-being.

Extremely high expertise and pride for our own and our colleagues' work are things we all have in common. We work with the largest enterprises in Finland, helping them succeed in building a better digital world.

At Nitor, you can trust us to take care of everything else, allowing you to focus entirely on your work.



Our recruitment process reflects our values and is a clear dialogue with four stages. You will have the possibility to meet at least four Nitoreans during the process. We offer you everything you need to know when deciding on your next workplace.

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt‚Äôs consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you‚Äôre interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app ‚Äì we‚Äôre a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry‚Äôs highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt‚Äôs name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we‚Äôre about getting things done. You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team ‚Äì people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates ‚Äì when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait ‚Äì we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Job Description

Are you interested in being part of building a service that is unique to the tastes of our over 20 million users? Would you like to be in the midst of it all, learning, growing, and expanding into new verticals together with us? Does working with Python and Machine Learning and building things from scratch sound like something you‚Äôd like to do? If the answers to all 3 questions are ‚Äúyes‚Äù, then great news since Wolt is looking for a Python Backend Engineer to join our Courier Logistics Estimation Team!

lies in one of the more complex parts of Wolt‚Äôs business - the logistics. This is because our logistics platform is responsible for courier task allocation and estimating delivery estimates that our customers, couriers, and merchants see. So, naturally, having a more efficient logistics platform would benefit everyone in our ecosystem: our Courier Partners, our merchants, and our customers. In this role you will be working closely with other backend engineers and data scientists as well as UX designers and frontend engineers who are working on quite a few interesting solutions. For one, right now we‚Äôre developing and deploying machine learning models for estimating different parts of the delivery process as well as designing and running experiments to evaluate their performance.

As a backend engineer in this team you will have a big impact on and be a key player in building new estimate, forecast or dynamic pricing services from scratch, figuring out better ways to run Woltwide consumer-facing A/B tests, as well as helping our data scientists integrate their new ML-based models into our Python backend, and, of course, learning new things from your teammates along the way.

So, if you‚Äôre an experienced Python engineer with a background in machine learning or similar field (e.g. data science), an interest in tackling scalability challenges, and building some real cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line. Also, you‚Äôll get a chance to work closely together with our brilliant data scientists (seriously, this is a great chance to learn a lot about data science if you have a knack for it)!

üìçThis role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.



üëâ You have fluent programing skills using modern Python, have experience setting up backend microservices, and building solid scalable services and well-structured applications using it.

üëâ You have experience working with machine learning or similar computational methods

üëâ You have experience working with Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration as well as familiarity with database technologies, such as PostgreSQL.

üëâ You have an analytical and curious way of thinking and are comfortable working with real-world data and its different nuances

üëâ Since the backend has mostly been written in Python (ofc) and Scala, if you have previous experience and willingness to tinker in the backend with Scala - even better, we consider that a plus!

üëâ Most importantly, you‚Äôre a dedicated person who is pragmatic with a positive attitude, who doesn't shy away from going outside of their comfort zone, and demonstrates curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

üíØ Overall our product organization consists of a team of over 700 people at Wolt. We aim to build none other than the best-in-the-world engineering team here.

üíô You‚Äôll get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don‚Äôt learn, we won‚Äôt stay still but fall behind, and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda‚Äôs greatest achievement.

üôå Join us for an exciting journey! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Lina Muncyte (name.surname(at)wolt.com).



Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions ‚Äì as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt‚Äôs products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt‚Äôs mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.



At Wolt, we‚Äôre about getting things done. You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team ‚Äì people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates ‚Äì when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait ‚Äì we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

Job Description

Are you excited about building the best possible experience for Wolt‚Äôs customers? Do you enjoy owning customer journeys holistically, and improving our service and optimizing different parameters of our platform to drive engagement, frequency and retention? Are you highly quant driven, while also always knowing qualitatively what our users would value the most? Do you have a consumer mindset, and willingness to build something extraordinary? If so, then we‚Äôd love to chat!



Wolt is a Finnish technology company and we‚Äôre best known for our food delivery platform. Founded in 2014, today we have more than 8,000 employees, 150,000 courier partners and we operate in 300+ cities across 25 countries. We have also expanded our platform beyond food delivery into multiple retail categories and are even running our own grocery stores with our Wolt Market brand. We are one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. During summer 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash to build a truly global consumer brand.

The Consumer Business team spearheads and owns the development of our Consumer Service, together with our Product and Engineering teams, as well as our country teams. We cover areas such as Consumer Engagement (developing our app better for our users), Subscription and Loyalty (Wolt+ and loyalty points) as well as Consumer Pricing & Promotions. Our job is to fuel Wolt‚Äôs growth, drive up user engagement, retention and frequency. We work closely with local operators, general management and product teams to get the job done, but take full ownership of driving our projects to fruition and tangible business impact. The team consists of high-performing consumer business professionals, pricing & subscription experts and data scientists ‚Äì all running high-impact initiatives with vast independence and responsibility.

We‚Äôre looking for a Manager, Consumer Strategy & Operations to join the team. You will play a pivotal role in driving frequency and retention within our user base through developing our customer platform further. You will be working side by side with our Product teams as well as country leadership teams in developing smarter and more engaging services, as well as rolling them out globally with maximum efficiency. In practice, this means that you will be the global business owner for various topics within:



You‚Äôd explore how we can seize growth opportunities within our consumer business ‚Äì and then make it happen through leading operational initiatives all the way to the lowest level of detail. In the process, you‚Äôll play a critical role in shaping our overall consumer business strategy. We‚Äôd expect you to be a pragmatic doer who is more than comfortable with data analysis and analytical problem-solving, but to also have a stellar business intuition and an eye for superb customer experience. In addition, you‚Äôll need strong leadership and stakeholder management skills.

This is your opportunity to join one of the most successful growth companies in Europe, disrupt the delivery industry and improve the daily life of millions of people!











If you are creative, like moving fast, and thrive in a dynamic environment where you get to be proactive and figure out what to do (rather than wait to be told) ‚Äì then apply today.

The University of Helsinki is one of the world‚Äôs leading universities for multidisciplinary research. HiLIFE Helsinki Institute of Life Science is a research institute that supports high quality life science research across University campuses and faculties. For more information, please visit (https://www.helsinki.fi/en/hilife-institute-of-biotechnology).

Most microorganisms lack homeothermic regulation which subjects them to unpredictable fluctuations in environmental temperature. Yet many microorganisms can withstand severe environmental changes and grow across large temperature ranges while maintaining cellular homeostasis and sub-cellular organization. The project will aim at understanding how temperature affects the cytoplasmic state in bacteria and what the consequences to cellular processes are. To study this, we use state-of-the-art super-resolution microscopy and single molecule tracking to record the movement of individual molecules inside individual live cells. Single molecule dynamics reports on the molecular interactions in real-time, acting as a probe for changes in the cellular environment. The obtained knowledge will help us to understand microorganisms‚Äô adaptation to different temperatures and the limits of cellular life.

The HiLIFE - Institute of Biotechnology, Jarno M√§kel√§ Laboratory of Temperature Adaptation in Bacteria, invites applications for



A fully funded position offered for up to 4 years. The start date is flexible from December 2023 onwards. The position is funded by a European Research Council project TEMPADAPT and an Academy Research Fellow project by Research Council of Finland.



We are looking for an enthusiastic and motivated doctoral researcher, who is interested in applying or analyzing data from super-resolution microscopy and single particle tracking to study temperature adaptation in thermophilic, mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria. In addition to super-resolution microscopy, the project will apply genetic engineering, sequencing, machine learning, and modelling to analyze, integrate, and make sense of single-cell and molecule level data. Our team will work on multiple topics at the interface of physics, chemistry, and biology: intracellular spatial organization, macromolecular crowding, liquid-liquid phase separation, heat- and cold-shock protein dynamics, and proteomics.

The appointee is expected to work full time on the Ph.D. thesis and to complete the thesis and the associated studies in four years. The successful applicant will apply to be a Ph.D. student in the appropriate Faculty. The Ph.D. degree consists of the student‚Äôs research project resulting in peer-reviewed publications, studies specific to the research field, as well as transferable skills training.



A successful candidate will have an MSc (or equivalent) in biophysics, biotechnology, molecular biology, microbiology, computational biology, or other relevant fields, and has demonstrated a keen interest in quantitative microscopy approaches. Experience in one of the following is expected: genetic engineering in bacteria (chromosome/vector-based methods), fluorescence microscopy data analysis or mathematical modelling of biological systems. Previous experience with super-resolution microscopy techniques, bioinformatics, and coding skills in Python/R/Matlab or a similar language is considered an advantage. Excellent communication and writing skills in English and the ability to work both independently and collaboratively as part of a multidisciplinary international team are essential. The candidate is expected to meet deadlines and manage their own academic research and associated activities.



The starting salary of the doctoral researcher will be 2400-2600 euros/month, depending on the appointees‚Äô qualifications and experience. A trial period of 6 months will be applied. The University of Helsinki offers comprehensive services to its employees, including occupational health care, support in access to high quality sports facilities, and vast opportunities for professional development.
