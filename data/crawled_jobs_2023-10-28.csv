We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally – Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games – played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.


Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you're bringing along.

In addition to Data Engineers, we also have professionals in data science, data visualisation, and master data, as well as a group of experienced data architects. With our work, we aim to create sustainable solutions – ones that we ourselves would like to use and maintain.

RELEX Solutions create cutting-edge optimization software to help retailers and consumer brands drive profitable growth. With growth comes opportunities, and we embrace both. Within our platforms, our teams are driving change, working with international colleagues and the latest tech stack to develop solutions that transform into a pioneering end product; it's tangible and impactful – for our customers and the world.



Our Technology team enjoy a challenge. They're hungry to learn, and don't hesitate to ask what, why, and how. They get to work with our unique, in-house database engine to create high-quality scalable code (just imagine, thousands of stores, millions of products, and billions of rows of raw data!) Their expertise positively impacts the environment and business processes around the world; alongside international colleagues, they drive change and develop solutions that become our pioneering end product. From functional programming, machine learning and interesting algorithms, to building big data pipelines, they're behind it all. They can work in a flexible way, remote or in-office – after all, they contribute to all our achievements, so we reward them with genuine work-life balance and access to every opportunity.

We are forecasting sales for our customers. The complex business logic algorithms and the underlying in-memory database engine (that we’ve built ourselves), that we use to do so, are all implemented using Java and JVM, both crucial technologies at RELEX. The amount of data and the complexity of our algorithms pushes the boundaries of what can be done on a single JVM, at most we use hundreds of cores and heaps of up to 6. Performance is a very important part of our business and we are optimizing it on every possible place, this includes understanding the hardware, the operating system and the different GC algorithms of the JVM in order to ensure stability and maximize throughput.

We’re looking for someone with experience in JVM performance tuning, together with an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of JVM garbage collection algorithms. It would be a great advantage if you brought some experience in distributed systems as well as reading or modifying JVM/JDK source code to better undertand behavior or debug crashes.

We make sure our unique approach to flexibility and work-life balance comes across loud and clear; we’re conveniently located, there’s plenty of public transport and you can even bring your pet to the office!

We’re on a journey with our pioneering technology and exciting growth, which is why we celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for everyone. We can’t wait to see what challenges you’ll overcome and what problems you’ll solve. Join us and work with the best. Be curious. Be RELEX – apply today.

Being part of RELEX means being heard, feeling valued and knowing that you can be yourself because you belong. We believe in actions, not words, regarding diverse hiring and employment practices. We take DE&I seriously. We champion and benefit from global diversity. We’re creating and evolving our culture to welcome everyone and value every idea.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaaja monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme.

Innostutko dataan liittyvistä työtehtävistä ja tahdotko päästä työskentelemään vetovoimaiseen finanssialan yritykseen? Oletko analyyttinen ja pidät ongelmanratkaisusta?

Vahvistamme vähittäispankin dataosaamista Helsingissä nyt Data Engineer Traineella!

Data Engineer Trainee, Vähittäispankki

Traineena tehtävänäsi on avustaa analytiikan osaamiskeskuksen datavarannon ja -prosessien kehittämisessä. Etsit dataa, rakennat dataputkia ja huolehdit datan laadunvarmistuksesta.



Etsimämme trainee on ennen kaikkea kiinnostunut datan ja datatuotteiden kehittämisestä ja hän haluaa kehittää osaamistaan tällä alalla. Hän kykenee analyyttiseen ajatteluun ja pitää tarkkuutta vaativien ongelmien ratkaisemista. Etsimämme henkilö ei tyydy helppoon ratkaisuun vaan pyrkii skaalautuviin ja kestäviin ratkaisuihin, joita on helppo jatkokehittää.

Katsomme tehtävän kannalta eduksi vahvat tietotekniset taidot ml. datatyökalujen ja ohjelmointikielten tuntemuksen (esim. SQL, Python, Spark, Airflow, Databricks, Jenkins). Katsomme eduksi myös tilastollisten menetelmien ja koneoppimismenetelmien tuntemuksen sekä käytännön kokemuksen DataOPS-menetelmin työskentelystä.

Työyhteisössä toimit oma-aloitteisesti, kuitenkin ympärilläsi olevat ihmiset huomioon ottaen. Saatat hyvinkin olla hakemamme osaaja, jos työskentelytapasi on systemaattinen ja ratkaisukeskeinen. Kommunikointi- ja vuorovaikutustaitosi ovat erinomaiset ja verkostoituminen on sinulle luontevaa. Hallitset viestinnän niin suullisesti kuin sähköisissä kanavissa. Sinulla on matemaattistekninen korkeakoulutasoinen koulutus sekä sujuva suomen ja englannin kielen taito.



Pääset mukaan DataOPS-tiimin päivittäiseen työskentelyyn ja auttamaan analyytikoita heidän päivittäisessä työssään datan hyödyntäjinä. Lisäksi pääset kehittämään osaamistasi parinkymmenen analyytikon kanssa, joiden kanssa jaat työkaluja, dataa ja tietoa. Data Engineer -kollegojen kanssa kehität yhteistä datavarantoa ja prosesseja pyrkien varmistamaan, että yksi tieto on yhdessä paikassa.



Tarjoamme Data Engineer -traineelle mahdollisuuden jatkuvaan kehittymiseen yhdessä muiden analytiikan osaamiskeskuksessa työskentelevien Data Engineerien ja analyytikoiden kanssa. Tehtävässä sinulle kehittyy ymmärrystä vähittäispankin liiketoiminnasta sekä monipuolinen tekninen osaaminen modernissa, jatkuvasti kehittyvässä analytiikkaympäristössä.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.

Näin hakuprosessimme etenee





Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa Head of CoE Markku Leskinen puh. 040 8269119 (26.10. klo 15–16 ja 31.10. klo 9–10)

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet sekä teetetään huumausainetesti.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitoratatrainee-ohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme

Oletko finanssijuridiikasta kiinnostunut tulevaisuuden tekijä? Haluatko kehittyä ja verkostoitua monipuolisessa ympäristössä Suomen isoimmalla finanssialan toimijalla?

Vahvistamme Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan -yksikköämme Helsingissä nyt juristi-traineella!



Harjoittelusi tulee keskittymään data- ja tietosuojajuridiikkaan eli tehtäväsi kytkeytyy EUn tietosuoja-asetuksen ja muun datasääntelyn käytännön soveltamiseen OP Ryhmän toiminnassa. Perehdyt lisäksi myös finanssialaa sekä digitaalista liiketoimintaa koskevaan sääntelyyn. Tulet tukemaan tehtävässä tietosuoja-asiantuntijoidemme sekä tietosuojan asiakaspalvelutiimin arkea sekä toimimaan erilaisissa henkilötietojen käsittelyyn liittyvissä selvittämis- ja ohjaustehtävissä. Kartoitat tietosuojaan liittyviä toimintatapojamme, raportoit niistä sekä koostat kehitysehdotuksia.



Sinulla on oikeustieteellinen korkeakoulututkinto tai olet vastaavien opintojesi loppuvaiheessa. Voit olla myös opintojen alkuvaiheessa, mikäli olet tukenut opintojasi tietosuojaan liittyvällä harjoittelulla. Tietosuojaan, data-asioihin tai digitaalisiin palveluihin liittyvä kokemus katsotaan eduksi. Myös selvityshankkeiden tekeminen ja raportointiosaaminen ovat iso plussa.

Tulet tekemään yhteistyötä monien sidosryhmien kanssa, joten toimit erilaisissa sosiaalisissa tilanteissa luontevasti ja rohkeasti. Työskentelemme pääasiassa suomeksi, mutta alan termistön ymmärtäminen myös englannin kielellä on tärkeää. Näet pienistä osasista koostuvat kokonaisuudet ja kykenet tekemään niin suullisia, kuin kirjallisiakin esityksiä. Työskentelytyylisi on itsenäinen ja olet tarvittaessa valmis tekemään nopeitakin päätöksiä.



Juristi-traineena toimit ryhmän Lakiasiat & Compliance –toiminnon Data- ja tietosuojajuridiikan yksikössä, joka palvelee koko OP Ryhmää henkilötietoihin ja dataan liittyvissä oikeudellisissa kysymyksissä. OP Ryhmä tarjoaa yhden Suomen laajimmista tietosuoja- ja data-asioiden toimintakentistä. Toimimme monilla liiketoiminta-alueilla ja digitaalisen kehityksen kärjessä. Tämä on siis aidosti näköalapaikka.



Tehtävässä pääset näkemään, miten iso digitaalinen liiketoiminta vastaa sääntelyvaatimuksiin ja miten muutokset näkyvät kuluttajien arjessa. Tueksesi saat vahvan osaajajoukon, jonka kanssa pääset toiminnan keskiöön harjoittelemaan sääntelyvaatimusten käytännön soveltamista.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Lisäksi tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen. Työssäjaksamiseen panostamme arjen tasapainolla ja joustavuudella sekä tarjoamalla käyttöösi lounas-, liikunta- ja kulttuuriedut sekä mahdollisuuden edulliseen lomailuun OPn lomaosakkeissa.







Jos sinulla on mielessä kysymyksiä tehtävästä tai meillä työskentelystä, lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa yksikön päällikkö Hanna Lankinen, puh. 040 723 0053 (soittoajat 27.10. klo 12-13 ja 31.10. klo 9-10).

Seuraavaksi haluaisimme kuulla lisää sinusta, joten hae mukaan kertomalla meille osaamisestasi ja motivaatiostasi viimeistään 5.11.2023 mennessä Hae nyt-painikkeen kautta. Alamme käsittelemään hakemuksia heti hakuajan auettua, joten tutustu monipuolisiin trainee-tehtäviimme ja lähetä hakemuksesi meille jo tänään!

Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet sekä teetetään huumausainetesti.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri-ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Haku OP Ryhmän vuoden 2024 Kiitorata-traineeohjelmaan on nyt käynnissä! Etsimme yli sataa ennakkoluulotonta ja rohkeaa osaajaa monipuolisiin, haastaviin ja ammattitaitoa kehittäviin tehtäviin eri liiketoiminta-alueillemme!

Innostutko datasta ja tahdot päästä hyödyntämään tietoteknistä osaamistasi finanssialan työtehtävien parissa? Vahvistamme Kehittäminen ja teknologiat -organisaatiomme Henkilöasiakasrahoitus ja asumisen palvelut -heimoa Data Analyst Traineella Helsingissä!



Traineena tehtävänäsi on avustaa OPn Henkilöasiakasrahoitus ja asumisen palvelut -heimon liiketoimintaraportoinnin kehittämisessä. Etsit dataa ja tuotat analyyseja ja raportteja, jotka tukevat liiketoiminnan kehitystä ja vaikuttavat liiketoimintapäätöksiin.

Trainee-jakson tavoitteita ja painopisteitä on myös mahdollista räätälöidä aiemman kokemuksesi ja mielenkiinnon kohteidesi mukaisesti.



Etsimämme trainee on ennen kaikkea kiinnostunut datan hyödyntämisestä pankkiliiketoiminnassa ja haluaa kehittää osaamistaan tällä alalla. Hän kykenee analyyttiseen ajatteluun ja pitää numeroiden kanssa työskentelystä. Etsimämme henkilö ei tyydy helppoon ratkaisuun vaan pyrkii ymmärtämään liiketoimintaa ja siihen liittyviä haasteita syvällisesti.

Katsomme tehtävän kannalta eduksi vahvat tietotekniset taidot sekä raportointityökalujen ja ohjelmointikielten tuntemuksen. Katsomme eduksi myös tilastollisten menetelmien ja koneoppimismenetelmien tuntemuksen, kirjanpidon ja laskentatoimen tuntemuksen sekä kokemuksen työskentelystä contact centerissa.

Työyhteisössä toimit oma-aloitteisesti, kuitenkin ympärilläsi olevat ihmiset huomioon ottaen. Saatat hyvinkin olla hakemamme osaaja, jos työskentelytapasi on systemaattinen ja ratkaisukeskeinen. Kommunikointi- ja vuorovaikutustaitosi ovat erinomaiset ja verkostoituminen on sinulle luontevaa. Hallitset viestinnän niin suullisesti kuin sähköisissä kanavissa. Sinulla on matemaattistekninen korkeakoulutasoinen koulutus sekä sujuva suomen ja englannin kielen taito.



Meillä pääset tutustumaan siihen, miten ketterää ohjelmistokehitystä tehdään ison finanssialan toimijan monitiimiympäristössä. Harjoittelujakson aikana saat kattavan ymmärryksen modernin ohjelmistotalon työtavasta ja -kulttuurista sekä siitä, miten tiimin tekemiseen on mahdollista vaikuttaa.

Meillä tulet työskentelemään arjen vaativien tehtävien parissa ja sen lisäksi, että saat valtavan määrän työelämäntaitoja ja uutta osaamista, pääset mukaan Suomen johtavan finanssialan toimijan matkaan. Tekemiselläsi ja timanttisella asenteellasi pystyt vaikuttamaan omaan urapolkuusi meillä, tuemme sinua omassa kehittymisessäsi ja kannustamme rohkeasti eteenpäin! Työllistyt OPn kirjoille palkalliseen puolen vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen 1.3. – 31.8.2024 ja tarjoamme niin sinulle kuin kaikille trainee-kollegoillesi saman palkkauksen; 3000€ / kk.

Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut.

“Meillä kaikki tyypit ovat piinkovia asiantuntijoita, joilla on usein monta rautaa tulessa, mutta täällä huokuu sellainen hyvä tekemisen meininki ja arvostus toisiamme kohtaan.”

Dagmarissa meitä ajaa ihmisten lisäksi datalähtöinen näkökulma markkinointiin ja olemmekin yksi Suomen suurimmista markkinointitoimistoista. Seuraamme alan muutossuuntia globaalisti ja haluamme olla askeleen edellä siinä, mitä asiakkaamme tulevaisuudessa tarvitsevat.

Asiakkaamme ovat kiittäneet meitä tuloksellisuudesta, eri toimialojen ymmärtämisestä, vahvasta digitaalisuudesta, modernista markkinointiosaamisesta sekä vastuullisuudesta.

Kanssamme pysyt aina ajan tasalla, maan parhaiden asiantuntijoiden seurassa.

Millaista meillä on tehdä töitä?

Pääset osaksi kunnianhimoista, mutta rentoa ammattilaisten työyhteisöä. Olemme kiinnostuneita näkemään asiat toisin ja luomaan rohkeasti uusia polkuja. Meille hakeutuu ihmisiä, jotka arvostavat vahvaa ja kannustavaa yhteishenkeä ja inspiroituvat yhdessä tekemisestä. Sparraamme päivittäin toinen toisiamme, sekä jaamme tietoa ja taitoa koko yhteisön hyväksi. Haastamme tekemistä ja ajattelua hyvässä hengessä.

Meillä on huikea työyhteisö, jossa tekeminen on hauskaa ja työtä tehdään tiiminä. Saat joustavuutta ja vapautta päättää miten työtäsi teet – arvostamme aidosti työntekijöidemme näkemyksellisyyttä ja luovuutta. Tuemme sinua kehityspolkusi määrittämisessä ja työssäsi menestymisessä. Saat tehdä työtä sillä tavoin, miten se sinulle parhaiten sopii - esimerkiksi viihtyisällä toimistollamme Helsingin ydinkeskustassa tai etänä, siellä missä luovuutesi kukkii parhaiten.

Meille on tärkeää olla inhimillinen työnantaja, ja haluamme tukea työntekijöidemme kokonaisvaltaista hyvinvointia tarjoamalla esimerkiksi mahdollisuuden käyttää osan työajastasi itsesi kehittämiseen tai liikuntaan. Lisäksi tarjoamme tietenkin lounasedun, polkupyöräedun, kattavan työterveyden, sekä erilaisia mielen ja kehon hyvinvointiin liittyviä etuja.

Tehtävänäsi on kehittää uusia markkinoinnin mittaamisen palveluita asiakkaillemme, joissa hyödynnetään tekoälyä ja algoritmeja sekä automaattisia dataputkia. Tehtävä edellyttää vahvaa menetelmäosaamista, mutta myös markkinoijien päivittäisten käytännönläheisten ongelmien ymmärtämistä.

Arvostamme kokemusta ja sen tuomaa näkemystä. Toivomme, että olet toiminut kehitys- ja asiakastyön vastuullisessa roolissa jo useamman vuoden ajan. Työskentelytapasi on itsenäinen, toimeen tarttuva ja ripeä, et pelkää vastuuta. Olet utelias ja nöyrä oppimaan jatkuvasti uutta.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader, Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



You wonder whatis? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform.delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.







What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position you can turn to Group Talent Acquisition Partner / Analytics, Michal Szafraniec at michal.szafraniec@wolt.com

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.





What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position you can turn to Group Talent Acquisition Partner / Analytics, Michal Szafraniec at michal.szafraniec@wolt.com

To accelerate the transition to a future where 100% of mining is underground, Newtrax eliminates the current digital divide between surface mines and underground mines. To achieve this goal, Newtrax integrates the latest Internet-of-Things and Artificial Intelligence technologies to monitor and provide insights on underground operations, including people, machines and the environment.

In their role, the Systems Integrator Operation Management is responsible to validate our underground product portfolio described above.

Job Description

Wolt is looking to expand its Security team, and we're hiring a Staff Security Engineer to help us build an even more secure Wolt. The security team is a multidisciplinary team which is responsible for all things related to information security, product security, data privacy engineering, physical security and safety at Wolt. Our Security team collaborates across Wolt's functions to enable us to build the first class product and service of Wolt. We work with full transparency and trust while focusing only on doing what makes sense. Continuous development is what we aim for as a team and making sure we remain as the business enabler and doing so by not settling for any result but always aiming for better.

📍This role will be based in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland or Sweden.

















The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Anna Pivovar (anna.pivovar@wolt.com).



Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Job Description

The Product Lead for Payment Platform connects with 50+ product teams around Wolt to understand their needs in payment functionality, and works hand-by-hand with teams responsible for delivering 16+ payment methods in 23+ markets. The challenge for you will be to build the payments platform that exceeds the expectations of other product teams and make our customers happy with the smooth payment experience. By addressing daily needs of current users you’ll have to keep in mind a scalable architecture to unlock new horizons for Wolt.

As a Product Lead, you will work with a cross-functional team of incredibly talented engineers, designers, product people and analysts in a high visibility role. You will be responsible for defining the roadmap and setting the vision for your team. This involves leading multiple projects and cross-team product initiatives across the entire product lifecycle, partnering with business and operations stakeholders as well as understanding our end-users better than anyone.

Your home base will be Wolt’s product management team but you will be working on a daily basis not only with the engineering team but also with the business operations and country team, who are responsible for the global and local businesses, When it comes to career progression, this role has a fairly clear path to a more strategy-focused and leadership-oriented role (e.g. head of product) over time as one delivers impact. We’ll let you in on a little secret: most of Wolt’s product people leads today have been promoted from within 🥳.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.



You could come to this role from a multitude of different backgrounds, but ideally, you have





The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Kris Connabeer (Kristofor.Connabeer@external.wolt.com).



Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 50 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

Job Description

Role background

Trust and Safety is a new global team at Wolt, focused on proactively mitigating trust and safety risks on the Wolt platform. It is a key priority for us that everyone can feel safe while using Wolt - be it for ordering, delivering or selling goods.

As the Head of Global Trust and Safety, you will have the unique opportunity to drive the development and execution of comprehensive strategies, policies, and initiatives that enhance safety and trust across our entire ecosystem.

Specifically, your work will be focused on reducing trust and safety incidents - to do so you will create policies on how to operate on the platform, you will identify root causes for incidents and form cross-functional teams to solve those, and will drive initiatives to increase the sentiment of safety on the platform.

In this role, you will partner closely with various global functions (including product, operations, legal, analytics, communications, and leadership) to drive forward company-wide projects with high strategic importance.

To succeed in the role, you must be comfortable working at both ends of the spectrum - you’ll be building the high-level strategy and also rolling up your sleeves to get things done!






If you are excited about working in a high-growth environment, taking ownership of things you care about, and being part of an ambitious group of professionals, then click below to apply and get the conversation going!

Along with a competitive salary and benefits, you will also be eligible for our stock option plan.

You will fit into a truly diverse team across 25 countries - what really matters to us is a caring and welcoming environment where we embrace uniqueness and celebrate diversity. Experience a company culture where we work on eye level, decisions are made quickly and knowledge sharing, as well as mentoring, is on our daily agenda.

If you have any further questions about the position, you can turn to:

Enrica Testa, Senior Talent Acqusition Partner at enrica.testa@wolt.com

Please note that we do not accept applications sent by mail. You should submit your application through our careers website!






You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

We work hard to make cities into better places, and it’s pretty cool seeing us grow every week. If you’re passionate about building things that just… work, Wolt might be for you.

Job Description

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you’re interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Hei sinä tiedonhallinnan ammattilainen! Etsimme nyt Senior Process Owneria Data Quality Management tiimiimme varmistamaan OP Ryhmän tiedonhallinnan käytäntöjen jatkuvan kehittymisen. Rooli sijaitsee Helsingissä ja voit työskennellä myös joustavasti etänä.

Miltä työsi tiedonhallinnan Senior Process Ownerina näyttää?

Senior Process Ownerina pääset viemään parhaita tiedonhallinnan käytäntöjä OP Ryhmän päivittäiseen työhön ja liiketoiminnan kehittämiseen. Otat keskeistä roolia tiedon hallintamallin ja tiedon laadunhallinnan kehittämisessä omalla vastuualueellasi. Tehtävässä korostuu proaktiivinen sidosryhmäyhteistyö ja OP-ryhmän merkittävimpien hankkeiden tukeminen. Lisäksi rooliin kuuluu myös tiedonhallinnan sääntelynmukaisuuden varmistaminen yhdessä muiden asiantuntijoiden kanssa.

Nämä ovat roolisi suuret linjat; sinulla on tilaisuus olla itse mukana vaikuttamassa siihen, minkälainen toimenkuvastasi muodostuu ja miltä hyvä näyttää tämän päivän tiedon laadunhallinnassa.

Edistät siis hyvien dokumentointitapojen kehittämistä, tiedon laatusääntöjen määrittelyä, niiden ottamista käyttöön, tulosten visualisointikyvykkyyksien kehittämistä sekä häiriöhallinnan käytäntöjä.

Opastat tiedon omistajia soveltamaan edellä mainittuja kyvykkyyksiä, tekemään juurisyyanalyysejä sekä tunnistamaan, mikä tieto edellyttää ennaltaehkäiseviä tai korjaavia toimenpiteitä esimerkiksi niiden riskipitoisuuden perusteella.



Tehtävässä menestyminen edellyttää sinulta näkemystä ja kokemusta tiedonhallinnan hankkeista sekä kykyä kyseenalaistaa. Senior Process Ownerin tehtävä sopiikin erinomaisesti esimerkiksi sinulle, joka olet toiminut aikaisemmin data governance -kehityksen parissa, toteuttanut tiedonhallintamallia ja/tai ollut mukana tiedon laadun kehittämisessä. Hyödyksesi on myyvä ja proaktiivinen ote, jotta pystyt tukemaan sidosryhmiäsi parhaalla mahdollisella tavalla. Senior Process Ownerina pääset tuomaan aktiivisesti avaintoimijoita yhteen ja kertomaan sidosryhmille tiedon laadun tärkeydestä.

Menestyäksesi tehtävässä, edellytämme sinulta aikaisempaa kokemusta tiedonhallinnasta ja käytäntöjen viemisestä organisaatiosi arkeen. Olet työskennellyt aikaisemmin aiheeseen liittyvien viitekehysten parissa (esimerkiksi DAMA International) ja tiedät miten soveltaa niitä käytäntöön. Osaat myös argumentoida, miksi tiedonhallintamalli ja tiedon laadunhallinta on tärkeää liiketoiminnalle. Sinulle on tuttua ketterillä menetelmillä kehittäminen ja pystyt hyödyntämään ketterää ajattelua työssäsi. Katsomme eduksesi aikaisemman työkokemuksen finanssialalta ja etenkin alaan liittyvän regulaation tuntemuksen.

Et missään nimessä tule työskentelemään näiden aiheiden parissa yksin, vaan toimit jatkuvassa vuorovaikutuksessa oman tiimisi jäsenten sekä sidosryhmien kanssa (kuten esimerkiksi IT, liiketoiminta, riskienhallinta ja talous). Pääset arjessasi tekemään läheistä yhteistyötä ja projekteja eri tiimien sekä asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Tämä edellyttää hyviä kommunikointi- ja yhteistyötaitoja suomen ja englannin kielillä.



Finanssialan toimijana voisi helposti kuvitella muuta, mutta olemme yksi Suomen suurimpia IT taloja ja tuotamme asiakkaille näkyvät IT-ratkaisut pääosin itsenäisesti alusta loppuun. Siksi meiltä löytyy tuhansia alan osaajia ja esimerkiksi koodarikulttuuri näyttäytyy jo nykypäivänä vahvana. Voit käydä tutustumassa eri tekemisiimme OPn Tech-puhetta podcastin kautta!

Meillä on käytössämme ns. 70-20-10 -periaate, mikä tarkoittaa, että käytät 70% ajastasi päivittäisiin tehtäviin, 20% työskentelytapojen hiomiseen ja viimeiset 10% vapaasti uusien taitojen oppimiseen. Tämän osuuden voit käyttää esimerkiksi meidän omassa OP Software Academyssa, jossa voit laajentaa osaamistasi monella eri osa-alueella. Kyllä, voit siis laajentaa osaamistasi työajalla!

Elämä on paljon muutakin kuin työtä. Meille on tärkeää, että työ ja vapaa-aika kulkevat rinnakkain ja työnantajana olemme valmiita joustamaan elämän eri tilanteissa. Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat muun muassa henkilöstörahasto sekä henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon, laajan hoitokuluvakuutuksen sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen.



Huippua! Emme malta odottaa, että kuulemme sinusta lisää. Voit hakea tehtävää lähettämällä hakemuksesi, CVsi ja palkkatoiveesi oheisen linkin kauttamennessä.

Kaikkea emme varmasti saa mahdutettua tähän työpaikkailmoitukseen, tästä syystä lisätietoja roolista ja työskentelystä OP Ryhmässä antavat mielellään Tiina Mäntykangas tiina.mantykangas(at)op.fi p.+358443264397 ja Markku Vuorinen markku.vuorinen(a)op.fi +358405540997.



Finanssialalla luottamus ja vastuullisuus ovat toimintamme perusta, minkä vuoksi tehtävään valittavalta henkilöltä tarkistetaan luottotiedot ja yritysyhteydet, teetetään huumausainetesti sekä suojelupoliisin teettämä perusmuotoinen turvallisuusselvitys.

OP Ryhmä on yhdenvertaisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta arvostava työyhteisö. Kannustamme kaikenlaisia henkilöitä hakemaan meille töihin ja toivotamme tervetulleiksi kaikki sukupuoli-identiteetit, eri ikäiset sekä kulttuuri- ja vähemmistöryhmät.

Job Description

Wolt is looking for a Flutter Engineer to join our Merchant App team, this team owns the Merchant Application - the main Wolt operating tool for the venues. The merchant app team is a cross-functional team consisting of 5 engineers, a designer, a QA automation engineer, a data analyst as well as a product lead, and a team lead. The current challenge for the team is to rethink and rebuild the merchant app - the one used by thousands of venues in 23 countries. The team has mostly new development work with little support of the iOS app. The in-store operations team is also a cross-functional team with 4 engineers, a manual QA, a designer, a data analyst, a product lead, and a team lead.

The team's main focus is retail, the current challenge is to continue to build the application (still mostly new development) and strengthen the basis for both of the teams. We tend to follow the latest development trends in the Flutter community and take action when needed. Our codebase makes use of layered architecture, reactive state management, and the Navigator 2.0 API. The project initially targeted only mobile phones and this year we are focusing on large screens with tablets, so do tell us if you have experience designing responsive user interfaces, this would be a great asset. We use Github Actions as our CI and CD tool. We do common things uncommonly well and ensuring we're keeping the Wolt-grade quality is key in our development.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.



We are looking for a, with a few years of professional experience working on mobile applications, including commercial experience working specifically with Flutter.

We’d love to hear from you if you’re curious, humble, willing to learn and strive when working in collaborative environments that provide a lot of autonomy.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Anna Janeta (anna.janeta@wolt.com).



Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

Job Description

Are you excited about building the best possible experience for Wolt’s customers? Do you enjoy owning customer journeys holistically, and improving our service and optimizing different parameters of our platform to drive engagement, frequency and retention? Are you highly quant driven, while also always knowing qualitatively what our users would value the most? Do you have a consumer mindset, and willingness to build something extraordinary? If so, then we’d love to chat!



Wolt is a Finnish technology company and we’re best known for our food delivery platform. Founded in 2014, today we have more than 8,000 employees, 150,000 courier partners and we operate in 300+ cities across 25 countries. We have also expanded our platform beyond food delivery into multiple retail categories and are even running our own grocery stores with our Wolt Market brand. We are one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. During summer 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash to build a truly global consumer brand.

The Consumer Business team spearheads and owns the development of our Consumer Service, together with our Product and Engineering teams, as well as our country teams. We cover areas such as Consumer Engagement (developing our app better for our users), Subscription and Loyalty (Wolt+ and loyalty points) as well as Consumer Pricing & Promotions. Our job is to fuel Wolt’s growth, drive up user engagement, retention and frequency. We work closely with local operators, general management and product teams to get the job done, but take full ownership of driving our projects to fruition and tangible business impact. The team consists of high-performing consumer business professionals, pricing & subscription experts and data scientists – all running high-impact initiatives with vast independence and responsibility.

We’re looking for a Manager, Consumer Strategy & Operations to join the team at Senior level and or Manager level. You will play a pivotal role in driving frequency and retention within our user base through developing our customer platform further. You will be working side by side with our Product teams as well as country leadership teams in developing smarter and more engaging services, as well as rolling them out globally with maximum efficiency. In practice, this means that you will be the global business owner for various topics within:



You’d explore how we can seize growth opportunities within our consumer business – and then make it happen through leading operational initiatives all the way to the lowest level of detail. In the process, you’ll play a critical role in shaping our overall consumer business strategy. We’d expect you to be a pragmatic doer who is more than comfortable with data analysis and analytical problem-solving, but to also have a stellar business intuition and an eye for superb customer experience. In addition, you’ll need strong leadership and stakeholder management skills.

This is your opportunity to join one of the most successful growth companies in Europe, disrupt the delivery industry and improve the daily life of millions of people!











If you are creative, like moving fast, and thrive in a dynamic environment where you get to be proactive and figure out what to do (rather than wait to be told) – then apply today.

Job Description

We’re looking for backend engineers for multiple teams inside the Merchant group. Our group comprises 10 teams touching Acquisition, Onboarding, Operations, Growth, Retention, and Integrations with our Merchants. These are cross-functional teams built with different skill sets, and we expect product engineers to collaborate with Data, Design and Product, ensuring we’re fulfilling our Merchants' needs.

Merchant products make Wolt an integral part of our Merchants' daily lives. We build tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use. Our products are built around self-service, which helps us keep trust at the core of our partner relationships. If that's something that gets you excited, don't hesitate to drop in your application.



All in all, you'd be part of a team that improves the Wolt experience by helping our merchants serve more customers faster while enabling them to focus on things that are the most important. If that's something that gets you excited, don't hesitate to drop in your application.



Observability and ownership from Kubernetes upwards are very much what we live and breathe. We handle the whole development process (business logic, testing, database & data streaming, CI/CD, analytics, cloud) ourselves in an autonomous manner. Don’t worry, we’re not alone: We have support from central teams when we need help.

We use modern tools and technologies. Current stack in use: Kotlin (Spring Boot, Ktor), Python (Flask & FastAPI), TypeScript, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Kafka, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.

We make the decisions as a team and group of teams! We are free to choose the technology stack and tools and make architectural decisions together. No top-down decisions!

There is a lot of room for learning, teaching and growing together. We will support you with the tools and materials you need.

We’re building lots of new stuff with minimal technical debt, so you can focus on developing new features.

You can choose whether you want to work from home, from the office or hybrid. It’s up to you and we don’t monitor people. We have a dedicated relocation partner to help you move to Finland. If you are currently living in Estonia or Sweden there is no need for you to relocate should you want to work from home but we will help you if you do want to move.

We have different people with different backgrounds. Cultivating diversity and maintaining different opinions is the key to our success.

Want to see the impact of your work? We provide our merchants with innovative tools and systems to become more and more efficient and successful, and with that our customers would also get a better experience when ordering with Wolt. We simply make it win-win for everyone!

This role can be based in one of our tech hubs inor, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.



Hands-on: We are looking for people who havebuilding high-quality software. This can include working with Apps, APIs and integrations, handling the whole development cycle all the way to production. Having said that, seniority at Wolt is measured by skills, not the number of years on your CV.

Skilled: We want you to be proficient withon the backend. We find expertise in otherlikegenuinely relevant as a starting off point for learning Kotlin.

Communicator & collaborator: We work closely with our teammates and having a good connection with team members is essential. We understand that everyone has their own unique way of communicating with others. We expect you to be yourself, express your opinions, and work together with the rest of the team.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Claudia Medri (claudia.medri@wolt.com).



Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

The Research Group of Prof. Anna-Liisa Laine seeks three post doctoral researchers for an ERC funded Advanced Grant project “Coevolutionary consequences of biodiversity change; Co-EvoChange”. The main aim of the project is to uncover how human-imposed disturbance in plant communities affects the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions both above- and below ground, and how these changes scale up to ecosystem processes.



We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of above-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios. The selected candidate is expected to take part in designing their project and take full responsibility for its’ implementation from data collection to presentation of results in both scientific journals and conferences. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plants communities. We will use a complementary analytical toolbox to identify how sensitive contemporary plant and microbial community structure and species interactions are to past biodiversity changes and environmental change. Relevant analytical approaches may include, but are not restricted to, Joint Species Distribution Model approaches (.g. HMSC; Sallinen et al. 2020), Random Markov Fields models (Norberg et al. 2023), and network analyses. The Ecological Memory framework can be used to quantify how much past plant biodiversity and environmental conditions affect contemporary plant-microbe associations and ecosystem functioning. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.






The salary of the successful candidate will be based on level 5 of the demands level chart for teaching and research personnel in the salary system of Finnish universities. In addition, the appointee will be paid a salary component based on personal performance. The starting salary will be ca 3400-3800 €/month. eurs/month, depending on the appointee’s qualifications and experience.

Open source is our beating heart and it’s something that fuels our work and our culture. It’s where we began. It’s where we’ll always be. Our vision is to become the trusted open source data platform for everyone. We are a Cast of over 400 individuals (‘Crabs’) located across the globe. Why Crabs? Because we believe in thinking sideways. And right now, we’re looking for sideways-thinking engineers.

The Engineering team at Aiven lies at the core of our organization. This is a great opportunity to become an integral member of the team as a Senior Software Engineer (Platform Infrastructure, Networking). We look for engineers who can work around problems by finding new angles. Thinking sideways. You will have the opportunity to collaborate with world-class tech people solving the toughest problems, where almost every project you work on is more complex and technically challenging than the previous one. If you relish pushing your technical boundaries, come join us. Because if you can truly think sideways, you’ll never look back.



So, how do we become the trusted open source data platform for everyone? By listening closely to our customers and taking action to ensure they achieve their business goals. You see, the software we create is merely a means of delivering value. Our thinking is customer-first. That’s why our customers are at the front and center of all we do. And in the spirit of sideways thinking, we’re by their side as well. Actively helping them solve their challenges. Collaborating. Sharing. And innovating. In other words, it really isn’t just about who we are. It’s about who our customers are – and where they want to be.



We want individuals who can embody our values of ownership, courage, and openness.

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don’t falter – we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We’re always open to new ideas – from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on our cloud operations platform turning the best open source technologies into frustration-free cloud services. You’ll be part of a team working on the Aiven cloud platform, improving its scalability and reliability, implementing new features as well as extending our product portfolio of open source data technologies

The burden of healthcare spending weighs heavily on economies, while the sheer number of options physicians and patients can choose from leads to uncertainty and unacceptable variations in clinical outcomes.

The online travel industry is an extremely dynamic and competitive space. We aim to deliver compelling designs that create a world-class customer experience. You will have a key role in defining the future of our products that reach millions of customers. Despite our size, we operate in a startup-like environment.

This is an amazing opportunity if you’re looking for an exciting adventure abroad while expanding your international research capabilities. You get a chance to live in one of the most beautiful and most visited cities in the world!





We’re obsessed with creating compelling experiences for our millions of customers, across our travel booking experiences. We want to make travel easy, and for everyone with an all-in-one shop experience on Agoda.

The Marketing Product Team is trying to bring users, directly or through paid channels, to Agoda, so that over time, when users think of travel, they think of Agoda first. The team is highly data-driven and focused on developing at-scale, measurable, marketing programs & features that improve the lifetime value of Agoda customers. With travel being an infrequently used product, this is far more challenging to do than in a regular e-commerce context. The role of research thus becomes increasingly important, to help us understand how users decide where to book, how we can become their default choice, and so on. Of course, as a highly data-driven company, all insights need to translate into compelling data, as our UX researchers partner with product managers and analysts.







You will own end-to-end planning, execution, analysis, and reporting of research projects, and you will need to consistently achieve research outputs required by the design team and product team for their pursuits and occasionally inform strategic decisions in Product approach or business domain direction:

In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.



At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.



We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!
