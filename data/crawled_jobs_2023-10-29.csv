Mitä Data Platform Engineer tekee?Data Platform Engineerinä ylläpidät data-alustaa, kehität sen uusia osia ja siihen liittyviä toimintamalleja. Teet aktiivista yhteistyötä alustaa käyttävien tiedolla johtamisen asiantuntijoiden kanssa.

Erityisen huolen ammatillisen osaamisesi kehittämisestä pitää tiimimme teknologiajohtajalta.

Job DescriptionData at WoltAs the scale of Wolt has rapidly grown, we are introducing new users to our data platform every day and want this to become a coherent and streamlined experience for all users, whether they’re Analysts, Data Scientists working with our data or teams bringing new data to the platform from their applications. We aim to both provide new platform capabilities across batch, streaming, orchestration and data integration to serve our user’s needs, as well as building an intuitive interface for them to solve their use cases without having to learn the details of the underlying tools.This role is not attached to a specific team, but after you onboard we would determine with you based on our needs and your skillset the best team to start in, whether that is more on the side of the platform, our user-facing tooling to operate the platform or improving our data integration tools.How We WorkOur teams have a lot of autonomy and ownership in how they work and solve their challenges. We value collaboration, learning from each other and helping each other out to achieve the team’s goals. We create an environment of trust, in which everyone’s ideas are heard and where we challenge each other to find the best solutions. We have empathy towards our users and other teams. Even though we’re working in a mostly remote environment these days, we stay connected and don’t forget to have fun together building great software!Our tech stackOur primary programming language of choice is Python. We deploy our systems in Kubernetes and AWS. We use Datadog for observability (logging and metrics). We have built our data warehouse on top of Snowflake and orchestrate our batch processes with Airflow and Dagster. We are heavy users of Kafka and Kafka Connect. Our CI/CD pipelines rely on GitHub actions and Argo Workflows.Our humble expectationsThe vast majority of our services, applications and data pipelines are written in Python, so several years of having shipped production quality software written in Python is essential. You should be very comfortable with typing, tests and managing dependencies. If you believe that software isn’t just a program running on a machine, but the solution to someone’s problem, you’re in the right place.Familiarity with parts of our tech stack is definitely a plus, but we hire for attitude and ability to learn over knowing a specific technology that can be learned.The tools we are building inside of the data platform ultimately serve our many stakeholders across the whole company, whether they are Analysts, Data Scientists or engineers in other teams that produce or consume data. We want all of our users to love the tools we’re building and that is why we want you to focus on building intuitive and user friendly applications that enable everyone to use and work with data at Wolt.Next StepsThe compensation is a combination of monthly pay and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie.📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Estonia.

We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams.

Sinä tietovarastoympäristöistä ja ETL-prosesseista innostuva data-asiantuntija! Haluatko päästä osaksi yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää työtä lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa? Hae nyt meille!BeAn Solutions on lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan parissa toimiva, vauhdikkaasti kasvava yritys, joka on erikoistunut vaativan sensitiivisen datan keräämiseen, validointiin sekä jalostamiseen. Kasvumme mahdollistamiseksi etsimme kolmihenkiseen tiimiimme nyt lisää vahvistuksia, ja haemme kehittymis- ja oppimishaluista, alastamme aidosti kiinnostunutta Data Engineeriä vakituiseen työsuhteeseen. Lue täältä lisää BeAn Solutionsista yrityksenä: https://www.beans.fi/.Omistajuus tietovarastoympäristöjen kehityksestä ja ylläpidostaVaativa sensitiivinen data on kaiken tekemisemme keskiössä, joten meillä jokainen on ratkaisevassa ja merkityksellisessä roolissa asiakkaidemme prosessien sujuvuuden kannalta. Data Engineerinä pääset itsenäisesti vastaamaan asiakkaidemme tietovarastoympäristöjen sekä ETL/ELT -prosessien ylläpidosta ja kehitystyöstä. Lisäksi työpöydälläsi on Superset- ja muiden analytiikkatoteutusten pystytys ja jatkuva ylläpito. Data Engineerinä tulet toimimaan jonkin verran osana asiakkaidemme tiimejä, mutta olet selkeästi analyytikoitamme vähemmän asiakasrajapinnassa, jolloin pääset keskittymään vahvemmin oman vastuualueesi substanssiin.Toiveenamme on, että uusi kollegamme nappaa täyden omistajuuden tietovarastoympäristöjen ja ETL/ELT -prosessien kehitys- ja ylläpitotyöstä. Meillä on asiakkuuksia, joilla on lukuisia lähdejärjestelmiä, joten vastuualueiden selkeyttämiseksi pyrimme keskittämään tämän kokonaisuuden yhdelle asiantuntijallemme. Ja mikäli sinulta löytyy syvällisempää ohjelmointiosaamista, sinulla on edellä mainittujen isojen kokonaisuuksien lisäksi mahdollisuus päästä kehittämään myös pienempiä tuotteita ja osa-alueita.Haluamme pitää katseen tulevaisuudessa ja viedä alaa aidosti eteenpäin. Tästä syystä meillä operoidaan markkinoiden kehittyneimmällä avoimen lähdekoodin data-alustalla – meille tämä tarkoittaa SQL:n lisäksi mm. Airflown, Embulkin, PostgreSQL ja DBT-työkalujen hyödyntämistä.Oman työn johtamista vapaasti ja vastuullisestiMatemaattisen tai teknisen korkeakoulutaustan lisäksi koemme, että tehtävässä menestymistä edesauttaa relevantti työkokemus vastaavanlaisista tehtävistä mieluiten noin 3 vuoden ajalta. Meillä kokonaisuus merkitsee, mutta haluamme myös varmistua, että tiimiin hypätessä sinulla on jo ymmärrys itsenäisestä asiantuntijatyöstä ja sen vaatimuksista, jotta sinulla on aito mahdollisuus onnistua kanssamme. Itsenäisen luonteensa vuoksi rooli edellyttää myös tottunutta ja sujuvaa käyttöä SQL:stä ja Pythonista, sekä syvällisempää käytännön ymmärrystä relaatiotietokannoista ja ELT/ETL –tietoprosesseista. Rooli pitää sisällään rutiininomaista työtä, joten toivomme, että viihdyt tämänkaltaisten työtehtävien parissa.Kokemus muista ohjelmointikielistä, kuten Java, Ruby ja Go katsotaan ehdottomasti eduksi, mutta osaaminen näistä ei ole kuitenkaan välttämätöntä. Lisäksi aiempi tuntemus dokumenttitietovarastoista (esim. Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) sekä terveydenhuoltoalan tai diagnostiikan parissa työskentelystä edesauttaa roolissa menestymistä, mutta ilman näitäkin meillä pääsee hyvin vauhtiin. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme vahvaa motivaatiota ja kiinnostusta toimia lääketieteellistä diagnostiikkaa koskevan datan parissa.Yhteiskunnallisesti merkittävää kehitystyötäYrityksemme elää mielenkiintoista vaihetta ja tarjoamme nyt ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden hypätä osaksi kasvutarinaamme. Pitkällä tähtäimellä tavoitteenamme on olla Suomen johtava toimija lääketieteellisen diagnostiikan ja tukipalveluiden raportoinnissa. Olemme kunnianhimoisia kasvutavoitteissamme ja etsimme tiimiimme jäseniä, jotka jakavat intohimomme kasvuun, kehitykseen sekä vastuulliseen toimintaan. Työskentelemme kehittyneillä menetelmillä, ja teemme jatkuvasti töitä sen hyväksi, että tekemämme työ tuottaa mitattavaa hyötyä asiakkaillemme ja laajemmin yhteiskunnalle.Ilmapiiri meillä on hyvin yrittäjähenkinen, joten meillä pääset ottamaan vastuuta omista projekteistasi ja organisoimaan työsi juuri sinulle sopivalla tavalla. Haluamme työnantajana olla joustava, ja pidämme työn ja arjen tasapainoa tärkeänä asiana. Muutaman asiantuntijan tiiminä vapaus ja vastuu kulkee meillä käsi kädessä, joten itsensä johtaminen on työmme sujuvuuden kannalta erityisen merkittävää. Saatat aika ajoin joutua hoitamaan muitakin kuin pääasiallisia työtehtäviäsi, mikä toisaalta tarjoaa mahdollisuuden monipuolistua ja kasvaa ammatillisesti.Kiinnostaako kuulla lisää?

Who are we?We are a Finnish-based international New Space company with employees from more than 57 countries in Finland, the US, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, and Poland. Our team is a tight-knit group of experts from areas including engineering, software development, and radar technology. We're innovative, driven people who strive for excellence in everything we do. Being advocates of our corporate culture, we value teamwork and curiosity, and we know how to have fun!What do we do?ICEYE is building and operating its commercial constellation of small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with SAR data available to customers. Our satellites acquire images of Earth at any time - even when it's cloudy or dark - providing commercial and government partners with unmatched persistent monitoring capabilities. Information derived from our SAR images helps customers make data-driven decisions to address time-critical challenges in various sectors, such as maritime, disaster management, insurance, and finance.Need for the roleThe ICEYE satellite constellation produces a huge amount of telemetry everyday. Inspection of near real time telemetry is crucial for operating satellites. Long-term telemetry analysis helps to understand the behavior of the spacecraft, debug sudden anomalies and provide feedback to the existing operational procedure as well as the design of new satellites.The work of Spacecraft Engineers and Satellite Operators require easy access to both short term and long term telemetry. Hence, there is a need for processing, storing and exposing the huge amount of telemetry in a meaningful way to our users so that they can focus on their strengths i.e analyzing the behavior of the satellite subsystems or monitoring of the spacecraft's health. With the growing numbers of the satellites, it is also neither possible to monitor all the telemetry parameters for each satellite separately nor carry out similar analysis manually every now and then. This brings the need of automation and creation of an intelligent satellite health monitoring system with necessary alerting features.ResponsibilitiesYou will work as a member of the Telemetry Team focusing primarily on the on-ground handling of the telemetry databases produced on-board. Development of highly scalable and resilient storage, services/data pipelines for both short term and long term telemetry analysis use cases. Build API to expose data to users. Understanding telemetry use cases from the users' perspective is important to build meaningful API for them. Development of a post-processing telemetry warehouse platform to allow meaningful data reduction and visualization.Develop a meaningful satellite configuration management system for ease of fleet handling and automation.Promote the use of meaningful data archiving techniques.Improve the data quality and reliability of the pipeline through proper monitoring and failure handling.Take active part in architecture-related discussions.Drive process discovery and resolution of technical blockers; generate ideas, and identify / solve problems.Produce simple, high quality clean code using frameworks, services, and reusable assets where possible.
Prior experience of working with satellite telemetry is not mandatory, but knowledge of working with large data-oriented software development is crucial for the successful completion of your day to day work. You shall be expected to analyze the data and develop software services for it.RequirementsYour work would include design, development and maintenance of both software and infrastructure solutions for an end to end complex data solution. So, overall this role is a mixture of Data Engineering with an interest towards Data Science knowledge. Work/proven experience in data-oriented software engineering ( 3-5 years)Excellent experience with data processing/analysis libraries (e.g. numpy, pandas, etc) and programming skill (Python)Understanding of Time Series Data Analysis and Visualization TechniquesInterest towards understanding satellite subsystems and generated telemetryGood communication skill to participate in cross departmental projectsComfortable finding his/her own way and living well in the continuous stream of change that is inevitable in a start-up that is beginning to scaleExpertise in non-relational and relational databases, understanding how different data structures can affect the performance
You are expected to work with the environment/tools listed below. Thus, in order to ramp up the work, a certain level of prior knowledge and willingness to learn more is required. Experience in distributed clusters and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)Experience in API development (RESTful API)Basic knowledge of infrastructure as a code (Terraform, Ansible) for resource and service provisioningExperience in cloud based development (AWS)Dedication to code quality, automation and operational excellence: CI/CD pipelines(Github actions), unit/integration testsGeneral understanding of good software development practices

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: Finance and Fintech is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You’ll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.About The Role And Our Humble ExpectationsI. It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.II. What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.III. Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.IV. What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don’t have any leads at the moment. In those domains we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.V. Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.Next StepsOur offering to you Lots of room to build the direction of analytics at Wolt.

Hei sinä tiedonhallinnan ammattilainen! Etsimme nyt Senior Process Owneria Data Quality Management tiimiimme varmistamaan OP Ryhmän tiedonhallinnan käytäntöjen jatkuvan kehittymisen. Rooli sijaitsee Helsingissä ja voit työskennellä myös joustavasti etänä.Miltä työsi tiedonhallinnan Senior Process Ownerina näyttää?Senior Process Ownerina pääset viemään parhaita tiedonhallinnan käytäntöjä OP Ryhmän päivittäiseen työhön ja liiketoiminnan kehittämiseen. Otat keskeistä roolia tiedon hallintamallin ja tiedon laadunhallinnan kehittämisessä omalla vastuualueellasi. Tehtävässä korostuu proaktiivinen sidosryhmäyhteistyö ja OP-ryhmän merkittävimpien hankkeiden tukeminen. Lisäksi rooliin kuuluu myös tiedonhallinnan sääntelynmukaisuuden varmistaminen yhdessä muiden asiantuntijoiden kanssa.Nämä ovat roolisi suuret linjat; sinulla on tilaisuus olla itse mukana vaikuttamassa siihen, minkälainen toimenkuvastasi muodostuu ja miltä hyvä näyttää tämän päivän tiedon laadunhallinnassa.Edistät siis hyvien dokumentointitapojen kehittämistä, tiedon laatusääntöjen määrittelyä, niiden ottamista käyttöön, tulosten visualisointikyvykkyyksien kehittämistä sekä häiriöhallinnan käytäntöjä.Opastat tiedon omistajia soveltamaan edellä mainittuja kyvykkyyksiä, tekemään juurisyyanalyysejä sekä tunnistamaan, mikä tieto edellyttää ennaltaehkäiseviä tai korjaavia toimenpiteitä esimerkiksi niiden riskipitoisuuden perusteella.Mitä toivomme sinulta & mitä etsimme hakemuksestasi?Tehtävässä menestyminen edellyttää sinulta näkemystä ja kokemusta tiedonhallinnan hankkeista sekä kykyä kyseenalaistaa. Senior Process Ownerin tehtävä sopiikin erinomaisesti esimerkiksi sinulle, joka olet toiminut aikaisemmin data governance -kehityksen parissa, toteuttanut tiedonhallintamallia ja/tai ollut mukana tiedon laadun kehittämisessä. Hyödyksesi on myyvä ja proaktiivinen ote, jotta pystyt tukemaan sidosryhmiäsi parhaalla mahdollisella tavalla. Senior Process Ownerina pääset tuomaan aktiivisesti avaintoimijoita yhteen ja kertomaan sidosryhmille tiedon laadun tärkeydestä.Menestyäksesi tehtävässä, edellytämme sinulta aikaisempaa kokemusta tiedonhallinnasta ja käytäntöjen viemisestä organisaatiosi arkeen. Olet työskennellyt aikaisemmin aiheeseen liittyvien viitekehysten parissa (esimerkiksi DAMA International) ja tiedät miten soveltaa niitä käytäntöön. Osaat myös argumentoida, miksi tiedonhallintamalli ja tiedon laadunhallinta on tärkeää liiketoiminnalle. Sinulle on tuttua ketterillä menetelmillä kehittäminen ja pystyt hyödyntämään ketterää ajattelua työssäsi. Katsomme eduksesi aikaisemman työkokemuksen finanssialalta ja etenkin alaan liittyvän regulaation tuntemuksen.Et missään nimessä tule työskentelemään näiden aiheiden parissa yksin, vaan toimit jatkuvassa vuorovaikutuksessa oman tiimisi jäsenten sekä sidosryhmien kanssa (kuten esimerkiksi IT, liiketoiminta, riskienhallinta ja talous). Pääset arjessasi tekemään läheistä yhteistyötä ja projekteja eri tiimien sekä asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Tämä edellyttää hyviä kommunikointi- ja yhteistyötaitoja suomen ja englannin kielillä.Mitä tarjoamme sinulle?Finanssialan toimijana voisi helposti kuvitella muuta, mutta olemme yksi Suomen suurimpia IT taloja ja tuotamme asiakkaille näkyvät IT-ratkaisut pääosin itsenäisesti alusta loppuun. Siksi meiltä löytyy tuhansia alan osaajia ja esimerkiksi koodarikulttuuri näyttäytyy jo nykypäivänä vahvana. Voit käydä tutustumassa eri tekemisiimme OPn Tech-puhetta podcastin kautta!Meillä on käytössämme ns. 70-20-10 -periaate, mikä tarkoittaa, että käytät 70% ajastasi päivittäisiin tehtäviin, 20% työskentelytapojen hiomiseen ja viimeiset 10% vapaasti uusien taitojen oppimiseen. Tämän osuuden voit käyttää esimerkiksi meidän omassa OP Software Academyssa, jossa voit laajentaa osaamistasi monella eri osa-alueella. Kyllä, voit siis laajentaa osaamistasi työajalla!Elämä on paljon muutakin kuin työtä. Meille on tärkeää, että työ ja vapaa-aika kulkevat rinnakkain ja työnantajana olemme valmiita joustamaan elämän eri tilanteissa. Saat käyttöösi monipuoliset henkilöstöetumme, johon kuuluvat muun muassa henkilöstörahasto sekä henkilökuntaehtoiset pankki-, vakuutus- ja lainapalvelut. Tarjoamme myös kattavan työterveyshuollon, laajan hoitokuluvakuutuksen sekä täysajan tapaturmavakuutuksen.Kuulostaako sinun tulevalta rooliltasi?Huippua!

The NORDIC INVESTMENT BANK (NIB) offers you the chance to do banking that makes a difference. The projects that we finance benefit the environment and improve productivity in the Nordic-Baltic region. We are an International Financial Institution owned by the eight Nordic and Baltic countries, and we offer you the possibility to work with experts from around the world. The challenges you will face working at NIB are unique and will provide you with valuable experiences. We value diversity and we are a close network of some 230 professionals located in the heart of Helsinki. The atmosphere is international and our official working language is English.We are looking for a SENIOR RISK MANAGER - Model Validation Lead to join the Risk Management Office in Helsinki.As financial institutions heavily rely on models, it is imperative for them to understand and manage the risks surrounding the models that drive decision-making. At NIB, the change (in 2020) to a risk-based comprehensive framework for capital and liquidity management further highlighted the need for rigorous management of the risks related to models.Model risk is the potential loss an institution may incur as a consequence of decisions that are principally based on the output of models, due to errors in the development, implementation or use of such models.NIB is recruiting to lead the model validation activities. The key objectives of this function are to 1) help assure decision-makers that key models are reliable, “fit-for-purpose”, perform adequately and comply with internal policies and external expectations, 2) increase stakeholder understanding of model limitations and weaknesses, and 3) contribute to ongoing model improvements.Your role Maintain the model risk management framework (Policy and Guidelines)Maintain the model inventory and manage the model validation programmeDesign and oversee the model performance monitoring and control processRemediate/address findings from the third line of defense (Internal Audit)Assist and educate model owners and users to improve model diligence, including promoting and enforcing sound model development practices and documentation standardsDevelop and manage indicators used to monitor and report on model risksAssist to integrate model risk into operational risk (and non-financial risk) reportingMonitor regulatory developments and best practices for model risk managementIssue recommendations (e.g. mitigating actions) to model owners and users following validation exercises and/or documented observationsContribute thought leadership on model risk and data governance with key stakeholders

We also lead the integration of increasingly important non-financial sources of risk into the risk management mainstream, acting in the second line of defense role when it comes to macro-financial (systemic) risk, business & strategic risk, climate risk (and ESG), and model risk.As a Senior Risk Manager, you would lead the model validation activities. As part of your duties, you would have frequent interaction with model owners, stewards, and users and provide direct input to key decision-making bodies. The role gives frequent opportunities to work with diversified teams of experts from core banking functions such as lending, treasury front and middle office, financial planning, accounting, risk management, and specialists in IT, data, and systems.

About AgodaAgoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.We have only scratched the surface. The online travel industry is an extremely dynamic and competitive space. We aim to deliver compelling designs that create a world-class customer experience. You will have a key role in defining the future of our products that reach millions of customers. Despite our size, we operate in a startup-like environment.Work in the heart of Asia. This is an amazing opportunity if you’re looking for an exciting adventure abroad while expanding your international research capabilities. You get a chance to live in one of the most beautiful and most visited cities in the world!This position is open to worldwide candidates and we will assist you with a generous relocation package, ensuring a smooth transition to working and living in Bangkok. The Domain of Marketing:We’re obsessed with creating compelling experiences for our millions of customers, across our travel booking experiences. We want to make travel easy, and for everyone with an all-in-one shop experience on Agoda.The Marketing Product Team is trying to bring users, directly or through paid channels, to Agoda, so that over time, when users think of travel, they think of Agoda first. The team is highly data-driven and focused on developing at-scale, measurable, marketing programs & features that improve the lifetime value of Agoda customers.
