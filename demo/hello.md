This project demonstrates the data science job market in Helsinki area, Finland, based on the Linkedin job posting data I collected for two weeks, from the end of Oct. 2023 till the start of Nov. 2023. Given the limited data, you may not see the whole landscape of the job market -- but I hope the glance can still be useful.
