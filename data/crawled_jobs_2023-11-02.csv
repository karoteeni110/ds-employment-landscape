Position Description

Vuonna 1976 perustettu CGI on maailman ja Suomen suurimpia IT- ja liiketoimintakonsultoinnin palveluyhti√∂it√§ ‚Äì ja tuhansien erilaisten uratarinoiden talo. Lis√§tietoa www.cgi.fi.



Haluatko ty√∂skennell√§ kehittyv√§ss√§ ymp√§rist√∂ss√§, jossa mielenkiintoiset ongelmanratkaisutilanteet ovat arkip√§iv√§√§? Jos vastasit kyll√§, paikkasi voisi olla tiimiss√§mme!



Data Arkkitehdin teht√§v√§ss√§ voit olla esimerkiksi toteuttamassa asiakkaamme modernia tietovarastoa pilveen tai rakentamassa integraatioita. Kanssamme voit vaikuttaa oman ty√∂si sis√§lt√∂√∂n, ja meille on t√§rke√§√§, ett√§ p√§√§set ty√∂skentelem√§√§n ja kehittym√§√§n sinua kiinnostavien teknologioiden parissa. Ty√∂ss√§si autat suomalaisia sosiaali- ja terveydenhuollon toimijoita sek√§ kuntasektoria kehitt√§m√§√§n liiketoimintaansa datan avulla.



Digital Society -yksikk√∂mme palvelee sosiaali- ja terveydenhuollon sek√§ kunta toimialojen asiakkaista. Tiimimme tuo yhteen tietojenk√§sittelyn ja toimialojen substanssin parhaan osaamisen. Tiimin ydinosaamista ovat data-analytiikan ja tiedolla johtamisen asiantuntijapalvelut sek√§ konsultointipalvelut, jotka yhdist√§mme CGI:n laajaan tarjontaan mm. palvelumuotoilusta, tietoturvasta ja ohjelmistokehityksest√§. Kun tiimimme asiantuntijat laittavat fiksut p√§√§ns√§ yhteen, osaamme esimerkiksi toimittaa modernin, pilvipalveluita hy√∂dynt√§v√§n data-alustan niin hyvinvointialueiden tarpeisiin. Meill√§ jokaisen asiantuntijuudelle on oma paikkansa, kanssamme viihdyt varmasti!

Tuleva toimistosi voi olla mill√§ tahansa Suomen toimipisteest√§mme. Jos kotitoimisto on enemm√§n mieleesi, sekin sopii meille. Joustavan hybridity√∂n avulla haluamme mahdollistaa, ett√§ ty√∂si ja vapaa-aikasi pysyv√§t tasapainossa.



Sinulla on jo kokemusta pilvipohjaisten dataty√∂kalujen kanssa ty√∂skentelyst√§, erityisesti tietovarastoinnissa. Teemme paljon yhteisty√∂t√§ sek√§ tiimin sis√§ll√§ ett√§ asiakkaiden kanssa, joten toivomme sinulta hyvi√§ vuorovaikutustaitoja, niin suomeksi kuin englanniksi. Ennen kaikkea arvostamme positiivista asennetta ja oma-aloitteisuutta. Toivoisimme sinulta osaamista seuraavista:



Tiimimme ty√∂skentelee muun muassa seuraavien teknologioiden parissa, ja eduksi katsomme, jos sinulta l√∂ytyy osaamista seuraavista:



Todenn√§k√∂isesti sinulta l√∂ytyy etsim√§√§mme osaamista, mik√§li ainakin osa yll√§ mainituista on sinulle tuttuja (ja mieluisia) teknologioita ja pystyt hy√∂dynt√§m√§√§n niit√§ tekemisess√§ t√§ysim√§√§r√§isesti ja kokonaisuuksien kannalta mielekk√§√§ll√§ tavalla.

Jos olet ongelmanratkaisija, jolla on intohimoinen suhtautuminen dataan, haluamme kuulla sinusta! Soittele rohkeasti Tuomakselle (yhteystiedot alla) niin keskustellaan yhdess√§ millaisia uramahdollisuuksia meill√§ voisi olla tarjolla.





Tarjoamme sinulle paitsi ty√∂n, jossa voit kehitty√§ haluamaasi suuntaan, my√∂s mahdollisuuden omistaa yhti√∂n osakkeita. Koska yli 80 prosenttia henkil√∂st√∂st√§mme on my√∂s omistajia, kutsumme henkil√∂st√∂√§mme membereiksi. Memberein√§ p√§√§semme nauttimaan CGI:n taloudellisesta menestyksest√§ ja rakentamaan toiveidemme mukaista yhti√∂t√§.



Meit√§ on 3 700 ymp√§ri Suomen ja meille on t√§rke√§√§, ett√§ jokainen meist√§ saa olla ty√∂paikalla oma itsens√§. Monimuotoiset tiimimme m√§√§rittelev√§t itse, millaiset joustavat ty√∂nteon tavat niille parhaiten sopivat. Meill√§ ty√∂ my√∂s joustaa, kun el√§m√§ntilanne sit√§ vaatii.



Meille CGI:n membereille on t√§rke√§√§, ett√§ tuemme ja autamme aina toisiamme. Et ole koskaan yksin: tuhansista huippuasiantuntijoistamme l√∂ytyy aina joku, johon tukeutua. Ja tarjoamme tietysti my√∂s laajan valikoiman henkil√∂st√∂etuja, jotka auttavat sinua voimaan paremmin.



Meill√§ viihdyt√§√§n pitk√§√§n, koska kokoisessamme talossa on tarjolla aina uusia uramahdollisuuksia ja niihin siirtyminen on tehty helpoksi. Kun kaipaat vaihtelua, voit ottaa haltuun uuden teknologian, toimialan tai asiakkuuden ‚Äì ja kun kaipaat ty√∂lt√§ joustoa uudessa el√§m√§ntilanteessa, sekin j√§rjestyy. Tule meille rakentamaan itsesi n√§k√∂inen ura!



Mahtavaa, mekin kuulisimme mielell√§mme lis√§√§ sinusta! Mik√§li jokin j√§i mietitytt√§m√§√§n, antaa tuleva esihenkil√∂simielell√§√§n lis√§tietoa teht√§v√§st√§ ja tiimist√§. Tuomaksen tavoitat puhelimitse numerosta.

We're looking for a Data Engineer to help us in our mission to spread joy through singing. In this role, you will build the data infrastructure that shapes Singa‚Äôs song catalog and overall product experience!

As Singa is going through a growth phase, rebuilding its analytics infrastructure is paramount.

As the company grows, getting accurate product, sales, and marketing KPIs data becomes increasingly crucial. Hence, the candidate has a big opportunity to provide an outsized impact on the company's future.

Singing belongs to everyone, not just professionals and pop stars. It's something fundamental to us humans. That's why we invented Singa - a modern streaming service for karaoke accessible by anyone, anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

We're building the future of singing by doing the same for karaoke that Netflix did for movies and Spotify for music ‚Äî updating an entire industry. We are uniquely positioned to become the biggest brand in a global market representing a 15 billion dollar opportunity.



Let‚Äôs face it. Life without karaoke is boring. Luckily, Singa comes to the rescue at home and Singa-powered karaoke venues worldwide.

The Singa karaoke app gives consumers access to a massive library of high-quality karaoke songs on mobile, web browsers, and Smart TVs. You can sing alone, make it a party with friends, or find the nearest Singa-powered karaoke venue and hit the stage.

On the B2B side, Singa helps pubs, bars, and other nightlife venues grow revenues with professional karaoke, background music, and display advertising software. We have a rapidly growing network of over 1,000 venues in Europe and the USA.



In karaoke, everyone can be themselves; the same applies to Singa. It doesn‚Äôt matter how, where, or when you work as long as it gets done. Individual freedom is coupled with equal amounts of responsibility and ownership.

We are all different but united in our ambition to make an impact on pop culture and our shared mission of making the world sing. Not to mention a few karaoke parties here and there, free singing lessons, epic staff trips, and other related shenanigans to keep it all interesting.

Who are we?

We are a Finnish-based international New Space company with employees from more than 57 countries in Finland, the US, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, and Poland. Our team is a tight-knit group of experts from areas including engineering, software development, and radar technology. We're innovative, driven people who strive for excellence in everything we do. Being advocates of our corporate culture, we value teamwork and curiosity, and we know how to have fun!



ICEYE is building and operating its commercial constellation of small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with SAR data available to customers. Our satellites acquire images of Earth at any time - even when it's cloudy or dark - providing commercial and government partners with unmatched persistent monitoring capabilities. Information derived from our SAR images helps customers make data-driven decisions to address time-critical challenges in various sectors, such as maritime, disaster management, insurance, and finance.



The ICEYE satellite constellation produces a huge amount of telemetry everyday. Inspection of near real time telemetry is crucial for operating satellites. Long-term telemetry analysis helps to understand the behavior of the spacecraft, debug sudden anomalies and provide feedback to the existing operational procedure as well as the design of new satellites.

The work of Spacecraft Engineers and Satellite Operators require easy access to both short term and long term telemetry. Hence, there is a need for processing, storing and exposing the huge amount of telemetry in a meaningful way to our users so that they can focus on their strengths i.e analyzing the behavior of the satellite subsystems or monitoring of the spacecraft's health. With the growing numbers of the satellites, it is also neither possible to monitor all the telemetry parameters for each satellite separately nor carry out similar analysis manually every now and then. This brings the need of automation and creation of an intelligent satellite health monitoring system with necessary alerting features.



You will work as a member of the Telemetry Team focusing primarily on the on-ground handling of the telemetry databases produced on-board.

Prior experience of working with satellite telemetry is not mandatory, but knowledge of working with large data-oriented software development is crucial for the successful completion of your day to day work. You shall be expected to analyze the data and develop software services for it.



Your work would include design, development and maintenance of both software and infrastructure solutions for an end to end complex data solution. So, overall this role is a mixture of Data Engineering with an interest towards Data Science knowledge.

You are expected to work with the environment/tools listed below. Thus, in order to ramp up the work, a certain level of prior knowledge and willingness to learn more is required.







Diversity & inclusion are core values at ICEYE. We are passionate about building and sustaining inclusive and equitable working and learning environments for all staff. We believe every member on our team enriches our diversity by exposing us to a broad range of ways to understand and engage with the world, identify challenges, and discover, design, and deliver solutions.

Could this be the role for you? Apply now to start your journey with ICEYE. We are looking forward to receiving your application in English as soon as possible.

We are making the impossible possible together.

About Newtrax

Newtrax believes the future of mining is underground, not only because minerals close to the surface are increasingly rare, but because underground mines have a significantly lower environmental footprint.

To accelerate the transition to a future where 100% of mining is underground, Newtrax eliminates the current digital divide between surface mines and underground mines. To achieve this goal, Newtrax integrates the latest Internet-of-Things and Artificial Intelligence technologies to monitor and provide insights on underground operations, including people, machines and the environment.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we‚Äôre looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader, Wolt‚Äôs fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one‚Äôs skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



You wonder whatis? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt‚Äôs well known delivery platform.delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you‚Äôll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.







What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who‚Äôs not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we‚Äôre looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You‚Äôll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt‚Äôs consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - Pricing and AdTech. This advert is focused on the Pricing domain, but if you‚Äôre interested in AdTech, please check this job advert.


The Consumer Pricing Data Science team is committed to consumer-first pricing that's fair, transparent, and compliant. We create innovative pricing solutions that offer clear value for our consumers. We collaborate cross-functionally to achieve both short-term and long-term business goals. Our team of Data Scientists and partners closely with Product, Engineering, Strategy & Operations, conducting experiments, advanced analytics, and operational reporting to enhance our consumer pricing strategies.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect Pricing, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office.

Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry‚Äôs highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt‚Äôs name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we‚Äôre about getting things done. You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team ‚Äì people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates ‚Äì when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait ‚Äì we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Job Description

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Lead for our Finance and Fintech domain in Helsinki or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we‚Äôre looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.

For an analytics leader Wolt‚Äôs fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one‚Äôs skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?



is our newly built team that will become a home for all the financial and fintech products reporting and analysis. You‚Äôll have a chance to join the team at its early stages and have a visible impact on the processes and decisions. The team will be working hand in hand with the FP&A organization and the payment and fintech product teams.





What we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as deliver insights and impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for everyone working in analytics at Wolt.



Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid ground and structure around the financial reporting with exceptional care on the data reliability and correctness b) provide Top management stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) provide all stakeholders with data-informed guidance and recommendations on things to improve and work on. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who‚Äôs not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.



We are looking for both team leads, who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership, and more senior leaders who most likely have 0-20 % of time to allocate to hands-on work. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.



We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that many of the domain specific analytics teams will grow to be teams with subteams. This is especially true for domains where we don‚Äôt have any leads at the moment. In those domains we‚Äôre looking for people who know how to scale analytics organisations. However we do also have team leadership roles in areas like marketing, advertising and content discovery where we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.



You‚Äôll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organisation, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.









The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realise you really, really want to join us!

If you want to check up on your application or have any further questions about the position you can turn to Group Talent Acquisition Partner / Analytics, Michal Szafraniec at michal.szafraniec@wolt.com

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership,‚ÄØenhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.


The Data department oversees all of Agoda‚Äôs data-related requirements. Our ultimate goal is to enable and increase the use of data in the company through creative approaches and the implementation of powerful resources such as operational and analytical databases, queue systems, BI tools, and data science technology. We hire the brightest minds from around the world to take on this challenge and equip them with the knowledge and tools that contribute to their personal growth and success while supporting our company‚Äôs culture of diversity and experimentation. The role the Data team plays at Agoda is critical as business users, product managers, engineers, and many others rely on us to empower their decision making. We are equally dedicated to our customers by improving their search experience with faster results and protecting them from any fraudulent activities. Data is interesting only when you have enough of it, and we have plenty. This is what drives up the challenge as part of the Data department, but also the reward.


We think of Data Science in Agoda differently. For us, a data scientist is a fusion of core production skills with analytic and business skills. We‚Äôve brought top talents from (literally) all over the world who focus relentlessly on building products which utilize ML and AI as their main edge. We know that when you infuse ML and technology, you move from good to great and that is our mission. Our Data Science managers are action driven leaders that can form vivid vision and successfully direct their people to execute it while being strongly rooted in the details and practice.

As a Data Science Manager, you will:

You are a developer of people. You love leading diverse teams of professionals with both qualitative and quantitative backgrounds using data-driven and insights-led approaches to respond quickly in a dynamic, competitive, and fast changing industry.

Tackle complex problems in the online travel and ecommerce space using a range of ML and data analysis methods. Use our huge data repositories to push our business metrics to their bounds, directly and indirectly. Foster a culture that constantly raises the bar for us and others and supports the freedom to explore and innovate.

Can we detect causation between metrics and bookings? How can automatically answer our users‚Äô questions? How do we tune our AB testing platform to ensure we aren‚Äôt optimizing noise? How do we measure experiment success to properly trade off type I and II errors? What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it? How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack. You will be impacting every aspect of the business and it will require various techniques, from diving deep into data with SQL and Big Data tools, all the way to deploying modern machine learning models.

. Work directly with the heads of the business departments and the product management team. Influence them with compelling product ideas based on data insights that can move the dial on our business.





We welcome both local and international applications for this role. Full visa sponsorship and relocation assistance available for eligible candidates.

We are now looking for experienced Senior Server Engineers to join either the Hay Day or Brawl Stars team. As a Server Engineer at Supercell, you are an integral member of a game team, working closely with other game developers and focusing on making sure that our hundreds of millions of monthly players get the best, most uninterrupted experience possible. Depending on the game and your own interests, you can focus more on the general game server infrastructure or new game feature development ‚Äì and sometimes you do both.

Communication between server engineers in different game teams is absolutely vital to our success. Our server engineers frequently share learnings, both successes and failures, across game teams to make each team better. You must be humble, pragmatic and willing to admit and explain your mistakes. That way, the next time something goes wrong, we'll all be better prepared.

If you have experience in developing live systems and using virtualized computing, and you understand what it means to support a system with large user volumes, you might just be the person we're looking for!








Luring you in with glitter, glamour, and gems is not what we seek to do. We develop Supercell as an employer for you to do your best work and to call this the best experience in your professional life.

We want you to enjoy your time here fully, so we structure our compensation and benefits to serve this purpose. It starts with perceiving you as a human being, not a resource.


We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released five games globally ‚Äì Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars.

To make five games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our goal is to make the best games ‚Äì played by millions, enjoyed for years and remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we create the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence that are core to our success.


If you love to think, talk, play and make games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams with the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games and the company.

We know it takes more than independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed.


Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you're bringing along.

Job Description

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt‚Äôs consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

Inside the Consumer Group, there are several teams, and two of them are currently in need of more Data Analyst support - AdTech and Pricing. This advert is focused on the AdTech domain, but if you‚Äôre interested in Pricing, please check this jod advert.


The AdTech team is a team that owns the end-to-end experience of advertising at Wolt. They build tools for merchants and brands that can offer increased visibility, and additional orders. Their long-term goal is to create a unified Wolt + DoorDash advertising platform that will benefit both global and local clients.


Our Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.


As a Senior Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect AdTech, we're looking for someone like you.






The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)


Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app ‚Äì we‚Äôre a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry‚Äôs highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt‚Äôs name, brand, product, technology and team.


At Wolt, we‚Äôre about getting things done. You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team ‚Äì people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates ‚Äì when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait ‚Äì we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Job Description

We are looking for an Engineering Team Lead to join our Marketing Tech Engagement team. This team helps our operational marketing teams as well as other teams at Wolt succeed with platform services and data pipelines. The team had its inception with marketing as its scope, and they are still the most important stakeholder. However many other teams in the company use our services daily. We strive to make our stakeholders‚Äô lives easier and our whole marketing machine more effective by taking great care of the design of the systems and user experience of the tooling.

The team is highly technical due to the platform nature of the services we build and maintain. Some example projects that you can get excited about working on are: Audience builder platform for targeting our users with offers, communication and different app behavior. Consents platform for handling and storing data about consents in a compliant and secure manner used by all of Wolt.

The team consists of 3 Backend Engineers and more disciplines such as Data Engineering will likely be introduced. There is an emerging Go community at Wolt and our team has been pioneering its use. On the backend we use Echo (Go) and Python (FastAPI). Our APIs are documented with OpenAPI or gRPC. Spark (Scala) and SQL are used for our data engineering. Our event engine is built with Kafka, Protobuf and Benthos (Go).

As a Team Lead you'll be an inspirer, facilitator, and an enabler for the team to do what they do best, by running the development cycles of the team, help design the technical solutions, hosting regular 1on1s, and taking part in recruitment. In addition, you‚Äôll get opportunities to work alongside our colleagues at DoorDash.

Feel free to check our Wolt Tech Talks here.

This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. üåç



We are not looking for any specific technologies in your toolkit. However, we expect a deep understanding of software architectures, integrations, a generalist attitude towards learning more and deep interest in all things engineering, and the ability to coach team members. A background in marketing is not required, but product development background is an asset as you‚Äôll be driving the development of top-quality software produced by the team and also communicating effectively with the Wolt teams at large.

Communicator & collaborator: We work closely with our teammates but also with business and multiple other engineering teams at Wolt so ability to build relationships also outside of your own team is crucial. We understand that everyone has their own unique way of communicating with others.

Servant leader: You already have some years of experience in leading software engineers, and have a coaching attitude. You have ideas and suggestions on how to improve the ways of working of a team and let them shine by striving for continuous improvement.



The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Severi Kausola (severi.kausola@wolt.com).

Job Description

Are you excited about building the best possible experience for Wolt‚Äôs customers? Do you enjoy owning customer journeys holistically, and improving our service and optimizing different parameters of our platform to drive engagement, frequency and retention? Are you highly quant driven, while also always knowing qualitatively what our users would value the most? Do you have a consumer mindset, and willingness to build something extraordinary? If so, then we‚Äôd love to chat!



Wolt is a Finnish technology company and we‚Äôre best known for our food delivery platform. Founded in 2014, today we have more than 8,000 employees, 150,000 courier partners and we operate in 300+ cities across 25 countries. We have also expanded our platform beyond food delivery into multiple retail categories and are even running our own grocery stores with our Wolt Market brand. We are one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. During summer 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash to build a truly global consumer brand.

The Consumer Business team spearheads and owns the development of our Consumer Service, together with our Product and Engineering teams, as well as our country teams. We cover areas such as Consumer Engagement (developing our app better for our users), Subscription and Loyalty (Wolt+ and loyalty points) as well as Consumer Pricing & Promotions. Our job is to fuel Wolt‚Äôs growth, drive up user engagement, retention and frequency. We work closely with local operators, general management and product teams to get the job done, but take full ownership of driving our projects to fruition and tangible business impact. The team consists of high-performing consumer business professionals, pricing & subscription experts and data scientists ‚Äì all running high-impact initiatives with vast independence and responsibility.

We‚Äôre looking for a Manager, Consumer Strategy & Operations to join the team at Senior level and or Manager level. You will play a pivotal role in driving frequency and retention within our user base through developing our customer platform further. You will be working side by side with our Product teams as well as country leadership teams in developing smarter and more engaging services, as well as rolling them out globally with maximum efficiency. In practice, this means that you will be the global business owner for various topics within:



You‚Äôd explore how we can seize growth opportunities within our consumer business ‚Äì and then make it happen through leading operational initiatives all the way to the lowest level of detail. In the process, you‚Äôll play a critical role in shaping our overall consumer business strategy. We‚Äôd expect you to be a pragmatic doer who is more than comfortable with data analysis and analytical problem-solving, but to also have a stellar business intuition and an eye for superb customer experience. In addition, you‚Äôll need strong leadership and stakeholder management skills.

This is your opportunity to join one of the most successful growth companies in Europe, disrupt the delivery industry and improve the daily life of millions of people!











If you are creative, like moving fast, and thrive in a dynamic environment where you get to be proactive and figure out what to do (rather than wait to be told) ‚Äì then apply today.

Job Description

Wolt is looking for a Flutter Engineer to join our Merchant App team, this team owns the Merchant Application - the main Wolt operating tool for the venues. The merchant app team is a cross-functional team consisting of 5 engineers, a designer, a QA automation engineer, a data analyst as well as a product lead, and a team lead. The current challenge for the team is to rethink and rebuild the merchant app - the one used by thousands of venues in 23 countries. The team has mostly new development work with little support of the iOS app. The in-store operations team is also a cross-functional team with 4 engineers, a manual QA, a designer, a data analyst, a product lead, and a team lead.

The team's main focus is retail, the current challenge is to continue to build the application (still mostly new development) and strengthen the basis for both of the teams. We tend to follow the latest development trends in the Flutter community and take action when needed. Our codebase makes use of layered architecture, reactive state management, and the Navigator 2.0 API. The project initially targeted only mobile phones and this year we are focusing on large screens with tablets, so do tell us if you have experience designing responsive user interfaces, this would be a great asset. We use Github Actions as our CI and CD tool. We do common things uncommonly well and ensuring we're keeping the Wolt-grade quality is key in our development.

üìçThis role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Anna Janeta (anna.janeta@wolt.com).



Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers.

Wolt‚Äôs products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff).

Job Description

Role background

Trust and Safety is a new global team at Wolt, focused on proactively mitigating trust and safety risks on the Wolt platform. It is a key priority for us that everyone can feel safe while using Wolt - be it for ordering, delivering or selling goods.

As the Head of Global Trust and Safety, you will have the unique opportunity to drive the development and execution of comprehensive strategies, policies, and initiatives that enhance safety and trust across our entire ecosystem.

Specifically, your work will be focused on reducing trust and safety incidents - to do so you will create policies on how to operate on the platform, you will identify root causes for incidents and form cross-functional teams to solve those, and will drive initiatives to increase the sentiment of safety on the platform.

In this role, you will partner closely with various global functions (including product, operations, legal, analytics, communications, and leadership) to drive forward company-wide projects with high strategic importance.

To succeed in the role, you must be comfortable working at both ends of the spectrum - you‚Äôll be building the high-level strategy and also rolling up your sleeves to get things done!






If you are excited about working in a high-growth environment, taking ownership of things you care about, and being part of an ambitious group of professionals, then click below to apply and get the conversation going!

Along with a competitive salary and benefits, you will also be eligible for our stock option plan.

You will fit into a truly diverse team across 25 countries - what really matters to us is a caring and welcoming environment where we embrace uniqueness and celebrate diversity. Experience a company culture where we work on eye level, decisions are made quickly and knowledge sharing, as well as mentoring, is on our daily agenda.

If you have any further questions about the position, you can turn to:

Enrica Testa, Senior Talent Acqusition Partner at enrica.testa@wolt.com

Please note that we do not accept applications sent by mail. You should submit your application through our careers website!






You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

We work hard to make cities into better places, and it‚Äôs pretty cool seeing us grow every week. If you‚Äôre passionate about building things that just‚Ä¶ work, Wolt might be for you.

We are looking for a Senior Product Manager to join our reporting focused team called Bobby Tables. Our number-crunching service aggregates data from multiple sources within and outside Smartly.io making it one of the most data-heavy parts of the application. Customers can analyze performance of their ad campaigns by using the flexible report builder and data visualizer tool our team has developed.

Besides providing a customer-facing interface to the online analytical processing (OLAP) system that allows it to run complex analysis, the service offers programmatic access to the Reporting engine powering such features as automated actions and automated budget optimizations. The challenges lie in different areas: the scale of the database (several terabytes of data), complexity of database queries powered by flexible query language exposed as REST API, having numerous stakeholders both on client and data ingestion sides. The data structures have been evolving from being focused on one ad serving channel to being abstract cross-channel.

As a Senior Product Manager in this team, you will be leading the vision and execution of enhancing our reporting services to a whole new level. Based on feedback from our customers we want to work on even better visualization, data integrations, and data injections in our reporting services. Your role will involve analyzing these customer needs and developing a strategy to address them. You will work closely with the team to ensure the successful implementation of these changes and to deliver a high-quality reporting service that meets our customers' expectations.

Cubiq Analytics on analytiikkatalo, jossa alan parhaat osaajat haluavat olla t√∂iss√§. Teht√§v√§mme on toteuttaa suomalaisissa organisaatioissa ennenn√§kem√§tt√∂mi√§ l√§pimurtoja datan avulla.





Onko voima kanssasi? Hyv√§! Etsimme tiimiimme jo kokemusta kerrytt√§nytt√§ Senior Power BI -konsulttia. Oletko sin√§ etsim√§mme vahva osaaja?

Teht√§v√§n√§si on kehitt√§√§ asiakkaillemme pilvipohjaisia analytiikkaratkaisuja Power BI:n avulla. Valomiekkoja emme t√§ll√§ kertaa tarvitse, mutta Power BI:n tulisi olla hyvin hyppysiss√§si. Haemmekin tiimiimme jo kokemusta kerrytt√§nytt√§ osaajaa, joka hallitsee datan visualisoinnin lis√§ksi my√∂s sen mallinnuksen. Senior konsulttina olet oman alasi asiantuntija ja jaat osaamistasi mielell√§si niin Cubiqin sis√§ll√§ kuin asiakast√∂iss√§si: otteesi on sparraava ja tuot aktiivisesti uusia ideoita esiin.

Power BI -tekemisemme kasvaa kohisten, mutta talostamme l√∂ytyy jo valmiiksi muita Power BI -osaajia, eik√§ asioita tarvitse p√§hk√§ill√§ ja pallotella koskaan yksin. Cubiqille tullessasi tuletkin osaksi yhteis√∂√§. Meill√§ t√∂it√§ tehd√§√§n vahvasti tiimeiss√§, ja asiakkuuden koosta riippuen tiimiss√§si on monesti my√∂s Data Engineerej√§ ja/tai web-devaajia. Asiakkaamme ovat suuria ja keskisuuria suomalaisia yrityksi√§ ja julkishallinnon organisaatioita, mik√§ takaa mielekk√§√§t projektit ja oman osaamisen kehittymisen. Emme ole toimialasidonnaisia, joten asiakkaamme ja toimeksiantomme vaihtelevat laidasta laitaan. P√§√§setkin laajentamaan ymm√§rryst√§si datan ja analytiikan arvoketjun valjastamisesta organisaation tarpeisiin hyvin monipuolisesti.

Rekrytointiprosessin aikana kartoitamme osaamistasi ja intohimoasi analytiikkaa kohtaan, jotta olisimme paras mahdollinen match toisillemme. Meill√§ ei ole turhaa byrokratiaa, joten rakennamme roolisi ja urapolkusi n√§iden keskustelujen ja kiinnostuksenkohteidesi pohjalta.












Olemme osa globaalin insin√∂√∂ri-, suunnittelu- ja konsultointiyritys AFRYn Management Consulting -liiketoimintayksikk√∂√§. Meill√§ p√§√§set osaksi energist√§ ja osallistavaa yhteis√∂√§, jossa on loistava tekemisen meininki ja ty√∂t√§si arvostetaan. Saat vaikuttaa aidosti asioihin ja luotsata omia visioitasi eteenp√§in. Vapauden ja vastuun lis√§ksi takaamme joustavan ty√∂ymp√§rist√∂n sek√§ kilpailukykyiset edut. Toimistomme sijaitsevat Helsingiss√§, Lahdessa, Tampereella ja Turussa.

Mit√§ mielt√§ t√∂ist√§√§n ja Cubiqista on meill√§ Power BI:ll√§ p√§ivitt√§in ratkaisuja tekev√§ Senior konsultti Johanna?

‚ÄúCubiqilla ty√∂skentelyss√§ parasta on ty√∂kaverit sek√§ vaihtelevat projektit. Monipuolisten ty√∂teht√§vien ansiosta p√§√§sen kehitt√§m√§√§n omaa osaamistani, sill√§ asiakkaiden tarpeet ja ymp√§rist√∂t ovat erilaisia. V√§lill√§ rakennan talouden Power BI -sovellusta ja seuraavana p√§iv√§n√§ kehit√§n asiakkaan Azure-ymp√§rist√∂√§. Omien taitojen syventyminen onkin takuuvarmaa, ja Cubiqilla on tullut opittua lyhyess√§ ajassa paljon!‚Äù

Our vision is to become the trusted open source data platform for everyone. We are a Cast of over 400 individuals (‚ÄòCrabs‚Äô) located across the globe. Why Crabs? Because we believe in thinking sideways. And right now, we‚Äôre looking for sideways-thinking engineers.

The Engineering team at Aiven lies at the core of our organization. This is a great opportunity to become an integral member of the team as a Senior Software Engineer (Platform Infrastructure, Networking).

What does that mean in practice?

We take ownership of the problems we solve. What we do is about improving life for our customers, enabling them to meet their goals. So we own our decisions and mistakes. Sometimes that takes courage. But we don‚Äôt falter ‚Äì we take on challenges with confidence. And right at our heart is openness. We‚Äôre always open to new ideas ‚Äì from wherever and whoever they come.

The Role:

We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on our cloud operations platform turning the best open source technologies into frustration-free cloud services. You‚Äôll be part of a team working on the Aiven cloud platform, improving its scalability and reliability, implementing new features as well as extending our product portfolio of open source data technologies

What You'll Do:







Don‚Äôt worry if your experience doesn‚Äôt line up perfectly ‚Äì we still encourage you to apply! We believe in investing in our crabs‚Äô professional growth.










Our Offer

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership,‚ÄØenhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

The online travel industry is an extremely dynamic and competitive space. We aim to deliver compelling designs that create a world-class customer experience. You will have a key role in defining the future of our products that reach millions of customers. Despite our size, we operate in a startup-like environment.

This is an amazing opportunity if you‚Äôre looking for an exciting adventure abroad while expanding your international research capabilities. You get a chance to live in one of the most beautiful and most visited cities in the world!





We‚Äôre obsessed with creating compelling experiences for our millions of customers, across our travel booking experiences. We want to make travel easy, and for everyone with an all-in-one shop experience on Agoda.

The Marketing Product Team is trying to bring users, directly or through paid channels, to Agoda, so that over time, when users think of travel, they think of Agoda first. The team is highly data-driven and focused on developing at-scale, measurable, marketing programs & features that improve the lifetime value of Agoda customers. With travel being an infrequently used product, this is far more challenging to do than in a regular e-commerce context. The role of research thus becomes increasingly important, to help us understand how users decide where to book, how we can become their default choice, and so on. Of course, as a highly data-driven company, all insights need to translate into compelling data, as our UX researchers partner with product managers and analysts.







You will own end-to-end planning, execution, analysis, and reporting of research projects, and you will need to consistently achieve research outputs required by the design team and product team for their pursuits and occasionally inform strategic decisions in Product approach or business domain direction:

Job Description

The Cart & Checkout team is looking for a Senior Frontend developer to contribute new features for our awesome consumer-facing wolt.com website.

The team is responsible for the end-to-end user experience from the moment users choose the items they want to order all the way through to get them to confirm the purchase on the app and website. Some of the key focus areas of the team are basket management, cart review, checkout experience and group orders. The team is a cross-functional team of Frontend, Backend, iOS, Android, Data Analyst, Design, a Team lead and a Product Lead. Their mission is to offer Wolt grade order experience on our platform; helping consumers to order in a fast, easy and collaborative way while providing a delightful user experience in different product lines.

In this role, you‚Äôll be working on improving and modifying the very app that millions of people in over 20 countries around the world see when ordering food and other products in Wolt. Our app is top-rated and we place a high value on an awesome end-user experience as well as a cutting-edge UI.

This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. üåç


We are looking for someone with extensive react and typescript experience, capable of delivering modern, testable and maintainable code. Quality is something we strive for in every aspect of app development from the user interface to having a maintainable architecture and source code, so experience with testing processes is expected. Implementing automated unit & UI testing and collaborating with our excellent QA engineers to prevent regressions will be part of your daily work.

Together we are working not only on new projects, but also improving the user experience for our millions of active users. In addition to the software development skills, we are looking for a team player with great communication and collaboration skills, workload organisation, flexibility and an agile attitude along with a product oriented mindset. We expect you to have these too!


The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Severi Kausola (severi.kausola@wolt.com).


Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions ‚Äì as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt‚Äôs products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt‚Äôs mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.


At Wolt, we‚Äôre about getting things done. You‚Äôll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we‚Äôre the very core of Wolt‚Äôs products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.


We want to have all sorts of people in our team ‚Äì people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates ‚Äì when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait ‚Äì we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great ‚Äì that‚Äôs what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?

In your day-to-day work, you will play a crucial role in our ongoing platform transformation, which will support our future business needs. In this renewal, we are transforming our insurance business into a new Guidewire Insurance Suite platform.

Demonstrating initiative, strong teamwork skills, and a positive attitude are essential attributes we seek. We also hope you are able to communicate clearly and understandably in English and/or Finnish, as effective communication is vital for successful collaboration within our diverse team.

We offer a stable working environment where you can contribute to our core values responsibility, people first and succeeding together.

You will enjoy a wide range of staff benefits, including a personnel fund and special terms for employee banking, insurance and loan services.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called ‚Äú70/20/10 rule‚Äù in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great ‚Äì that‚Äôs what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

We are currently in the process of transitioning from on-premises systems to a cloud-based platform, and we're offering you the chance to be a part of this transformation and work with cutting-edge technologies.

In your day-to-day work, you will play a crucial role in our ongoing platform transformation, which will support our future business needs. In this renewal, we are transforming our insurance business into a new Guidewire Insurance Suite platform. Thanks to this transformation, in the future we are going to be able to handle insurance, billing & collections and claims all in one platform!

Furthermore, as a Data Engineer in OP Life Insurance you will get to work in our risk life renewal program and its data integration team. Your role will include technical data integration, covering both operational integrations and the utilization of operational analytics.

The opportunity is available in Helsinki and like the rest of OP, we work in a flexible manner, combining both office days and remote work.



Our recruitment is not meant to seem like a puzzle, so we strive to tell you as clearly as possible what kind of expertise we believe is crucial to thriving in this role. Foremost we hope that you are someone with experience with Data Engineering work and thrive to continuously learn more!

Here are some of the requirements and technologies you will work with include



We understand that you might not have experience in all these areas just yet, but what really matters is your motivation and willingness to learn and grow. At OP Life, we also highly value the ability to work effectively within a team and, when needed, the ability to step up and take leadership in projects. Demonstrating initiative, strong teamwork skills, and a positive attitude are essential attributes we seek. We also hope you are able to communicate clearly and understandably in English and/or Finnish, as effective communication is vital for successful collaboration within our diverse team.



To help counterbalance work where you are expected to take a lot of responsibility, we seek to ensure employee wellbeing and to enable forward-looking work arrangements. We offer a stable working environment where you can contribute to our core values responsibility, people first and succeeding together.

You will enjoy a wide range of staff benefits, including a personnel fund and special terms for employee banking, insurance and loan services. We offer comprehensive occupational health care, extensive medical treatment expenses insurance and a full-time group accident insurance policy. Furthermore, we invest in wellbeing at work by encouraging a good work-life balance, providing flexibility in your daily life, and offering lunch, sport and cultural benefits and opportunities for affordable holidays in OP timeshares.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called ‚Äú70/20/10 rule‚Äù in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great ‚Äì that‚Äôs what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

Our Tech Lead Abhishek Dutta (tel. +358 50 410 4235) will be happy to answer your questions. You can reach Abhishek best on the following dates and times Thursday, November 2nd, from 2 PM to 3 PM and Friday, November 3rd, from 2 PM to 3 PM. Talk to you soon future colleague!

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

We also encourage and help you to further develop yourself as a technical professional. We have the so called ‚Äú70/20/10 rule‚Äù in use, which means you will use 70% of your time for your daily tasks, 20% to develop the way you do those tasks, and the last 10% is reserved for you to learn and try new things. You will also have our OP Software Academy at your disposal in case you are interested in learning new technologies or methodologies, or why not in honing your skills in your current stack.



Great ‚Äì that‚Äôs what we were hoping for! The application period is open until Sunday 12.11.2023. Any questions in mind?

THE OPPORTUNITY IN A NUTSHELL

You? A data engineer with an analytic mindset or an analyst with data engineering skills. Whether you have a few years of experience or have been around for a while, we‚Äôre interested in hearing from you.

As a Data Warehouse Engineer in our company, you will take part in constructing state-of-the-art Data Warehouses tailored for Nordic Marketplaces, empowering data-informed decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams to engineer robust, agile solutions.

AWS, Snowflake, Redshift, Matillion, Python, DBT, Tableau

You can apply to work at one of our hubs in Aarhus or Helsinki. Most of us work some days from home a couple of days a week and love meeting our colleagues weekly for collaboration. If you like, you can of course work from the office every day.

FINN.no in Norway, Bilbasen and DBA in Denmark, Oikotie and Tori in Finland, and Blocket in Sweden, recently joined forces, collectively forming. Together, we serve over 325 million monthly visits in the Nordics. By joining forces, we are on a transformative journey toward becoming a next-generation marketplace. To achieve this ambitious goal, we're building a marketplace platform that will propel our verticals (Jobs, Mobility, Real Estate, ReCommerce) to a leading position in all countries. Our technology unit is instrumental to our success story, deploying new code to production over 1800 times per week.

In this role, you will have an unique opportunity to build and form the Data Warehouse for Nordic Marketplaces to empower the organisation to take data driven decisions. We believe that the best solutions come in collaboration with others and that freedom and a sense of responsibility are more effective than detailed management.











As a part of our team you will work in close collaboration with both domain teams and analysts as well as your peers within our team and sister teams. Having a structured and analytical mindset is essential, as well as being able to decipher domain data models and data products, and transform those into analytical models to support business requirements by analysts and other stakeholders. You will be working with building high quality data pipelines to feed those models for different verticals as well as horizontal models across. This will be done using the Schibsted Common Analytical Model as one of the core building blocks.



We are a large, distributed and highly diverse team spread across most out the Nordics and Poland. Our team consists of 12 people, with broad diversity in both background and age-span. We're part of the data platform area, together with other teams like data platform engineering, data management, recommendation as well as data enablement teams for data science and data mesh. We are one out of 50 teams of talented individuals with diverse backgrounds, intellects and identities.

We work closely with the technical domain teams to understand the data we are dealing with as well as our main stakeholders within insight and analysts as well as functions like finance and sales. We work according to agile principles with continuous deployment and improvements. We meet up several times during the year in our different locations.



Right now we are navigating around in the new, Nordic organisation, balancing both the legacy systems while building the new stuff, which is both demanding and exciting at the same time.

On the other hand, this brings along a great opportunity to leave your fingerprint on how our future Data Warehouse is drafted and to support the rest of the organisation with key metrics and analyses both during and after the transition! Is your curious mind asking for this kind of adventure?



If you are looking for a workplace and the role in which you could share your knowledge and expertise, learn and grow, get inspired, be yourself, and make a difference, let us hear from you by 20.11.2023. We value diversity and welcome applicants from all backgrounds.
