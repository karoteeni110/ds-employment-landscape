Haemme nyt Installe Data Warehouse Developeria työskentelemään teollisuuden ja talouden BI&DW-projektien parissa. Insta palvelee teollisuuden asiakkaitaan yli 60 vuoden kokemuksella teollisuusautomaatiosta ja teollisen datan keräämisestä. MITÄ TEHTÄVÄ TARJOAA SINULLE? Tehtävässä otat omistajuuden Instan sisäisen talouden raportoinnin ratkaisun kehityksestä ja työskentelet myös Insta Industrial Data Platform –tuotteen ja siihen liittyvien asiakasprojektien parissa. Aikasi jakautuu noin 50/50 sisäisen kehityksen ja asiakasprojektien välillä.Tehtävä on ns. full-stack data rooli, jossa työskentelet sekä tietovarastojen että raportoinnin kehityksen parissa. Päivittäiseen työhösi kuuluu esimerkiksi tietomallinnusta, ETL-putkien rakentamista ja datan visualisointia. Pääset työskentelemään läheisesti suoraan asiakkaidemme kanssa asiakkaan tarpeiden kartoittamisesta ratkaisujen luomiseen ja esittelyyn, eikä asiakasprojekteja ei tarvitse tehdä yksin, sillä projektit toteutuvat omalla tiimillämme. Koska työskentelemme pitkissä asiakassuhteissa, pääset myös näkemään työsi konkreettiset hyödyt. “Mielestäni Insta erottuu joukosta siinä, että meiltä löytyy osaamista alkaen automaatiojärjestelmistä aina älykkäisiin pilviratkaisuihin ja tietoturvaan. Tämä antaa parhaat lähtökohdat datan hyödyntämiseen ja kokonaisvaltaisten ratkaisuiden tarjoamiseen.” -Business Intelligence Architect Iiro Pihlajaniemi Työsi on vaihtelevaa, sillä pääset työskentelemään erilaisissa ympäristöissä ja eri sidosryhmiemme kanssa. Saat sekä vapautta että vastuuta, mikä on mukavaa vain, jos nautit molemmista. Voit työskennellä tehtävässä Vantaan tai Tampereen Finlaysonin toimistoillamme tai pääsääntöisesti etänä missä vain päin Suomea tahdot. Myös Rovaniemi on mahdollinen sijainti, ja sinulla on siellä myös paikallinen kollega. MITÄ TOIVOMME SINULTA Toivomme että sinulla on vähintään muutama vuosi käytännön kokemusta datan parista, mieluiten sekä raportoinnin että tietovarastokehityksen puolelta. Lisäksi toivomme, että voit ottaa tarvittaessa vastuun kokonaisen DW&BI –ratkaisun kehityksestä. Rakennamme ratkaisumme lähtökohtaisesti Microsoftin Azureen. Odotamme hakijalta kohtuullista osaamista Microsoftin datateknologioista. Kokemus sekä on premise- että pilvidataratkaisuista on tehtävässä hyödyksi. Pystymme myös tarvittaessa täydentämään aikaisempaa osaamistasi kouluttamalla ja tuemme itseopiskelumalleilla esimerkiksi Azure-sertifikaattien suorittamista. Arvostamme sinulta erityisesti osaamista seuraavilta osa-alueilta:  Tietokanta- ja SQL-osaamista Tietomallinnusosaamista, esimerkiksi Data Vault 2.0 ja dimensionaaliset tähtimallit ETL-putkien rakentaminen, esimerkiksi Synapse pipelines, Data factory ja SSIS Raportointityökalut, erityisesti Power BI Microsoftin on-premise datatyökalut: SSIS, SSAS, MS SQL Server Microsoft Azuren datatyökalut: Synapse, Data factory, Azure db, data lake Myös PowerApps osaaminen on eduksi Teollisuuden toimialatuntemus ja talousraportoinnin osaaminen (kirjanpito, P&L, ennusteet & budjetointi) ovat eduksi 
Olet tehtävässä myös suorassa asiakaskontaktissa, joten toivomme, että pystyt sujuvasti viestimään asiakkaiden kanssa ja ratkomaan ongelmia omatoimisesti. Työtä tehdään sekä itsenäisesti että tiimin kanssa projektista riippuen. Tahdot pysyä nopeasti kehittyvän teknologian mukana, ja näet uuden oppimisen positiivisena osana päivittäistä työtä. Tehtävä vaatii sujuvaa suomen ja englannin kielitaitoa. MEIDÄN TIIMI Ympärilläsi on kokenut ja monipuolinen Smart Factory –tiimi, jossa työskentelee erilaisten profiilien osaajia: devaajia, pilvi- ja DevOps-asiantuntijoita, data scientisteja ja BI/DW asiantuntijoita. Tiimi on geografisesti keskittynyt Tampereelle, vaikka sen jäseniä on myös pk-seudulla ja Rovaniemellä. Tiimin jäseniä yhdistää luontainen uteliaisuus ja intohimo työtään kohtaan, ja he pitävät yhtä projektista toiseen. Ajoittain joudut sietämään myös tiimin huonoa huumoria. Sisäisessä talouden raportoinnin projektissa kanssasi työskentelee muutama Insta Groupin analyytikko sekä alustan omistaja. Myös tähän saat totta kai tukea myös Smart Factory -tiimistä tarvittaessa. Suomalaisena perheyhtiönä mottomme ""Lupa luottaa"" konkretisoituu jokapäiväisessä työssämme. Maksamme osaamistasi vastaavan kilpailukykyisen palkan muine etuineen. Kattavaan etupakettiimme kuuluu esimerkiksi liikunnan ja kulttuurin lisäksi hieronta- ja joukkoliikenne-etu, laaja vapaa-ajan tapaturmavakuutus ja työsuhdepyörä. Työn- ja vapaa-ajan yhteensovittaminen sujuu meillä erilaisissa elämäntilanteissa vaivatta joustavien työaikojen ja perhemyönteisen kulttuurin ansiosta. Meillä voidaan hyvin ja viihdytään pitkään! “Koska Insta on monitoimialayritys, täällä voi aidosti tehdä monta uraa saman firman sisällä. Työura on nykyihmisellä pitkä ja mutkitteleva, ja tämän hetken todellisuus voi muuttua ihan toiseksi tulevassa. Olen aina päässyt tekemään sitä, mikä minusta on kulloinkin hienoa. Kun ohjaa aktiivisesti omaa tekemistään eikä jää jumiin nykyiseen osaamiseen, pääsee kehittymään. Eteenpäin, sano mummo lumessa!” -Solution Lead, Seppo Merikoski KIINNOSTUITKO?

DATA ARCHITECTWould you like to be a part of Recordly's story? Now is your chance! We’re looking for a Data Architect eager to help businesses capitalize on the opportunities data offers. Working at Recordly means you get to work with customers that truly want to make data their competitive edge.“WHO/WHAT IS RECORDLY?” YOU MIGHT ASKRecordly is an independent company party of the Futurice family specializing in business data management. Our core business focuses on data management, data architectures, and hands-on data engineering that enable exceptional user experiences, efficiency gains, and new business models. In simple terms, we tech the heck out of data.Our employee promise (besides offering engaging customer assignments of course) includes the possibility to enjoy the company's success and shape who we are and what we do, together. We believe in being open about how the business is going and how the choices we make affect the bottom line. Take a look at our site to get to know us better.NOW TO THE ROLE ITSELFA Data Architect at Recordly typically works in tight cooperation with our customers within different assignments. Assignments vary and may sometimes even require hands-on work from time to time - meaning you may have to open up AWS/Azure/GCP Console and deploy some resources if needed or write some SQL lines when the Data Engineers are not around. As we focus on creating actual business value by creating or utilizing for example data platforms, we value the following skills:  Excellent communication skills both verbal and written, along with the ability to influence and demonstrate confidence in communications with senior-level management. Ability to understand and translate business requirements into data and technical requirements. - And we truly mean this. We want to be the glue, bridge, sellotape - whatever you want to call it - between the IT and business departments so that they understand each other.  Ability to cope with ever-evolving technologies used in the data domain and simultaneously understand the business and engineering side of new data products. - Yes, we know this sounds awful. The data domain is moving 88 miles per hour, making it difficult for anyone to keep up with, for example, what Apache Foundation is releasing next month. Fear not, however, we will help you with this with our continuous learning opportunities and hackathons. Working knowledge of Agile development, including DevOps and DataOps concepts.

DATA ARCHITECT,"Data Analytics, Data Warehousing, and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)Business Requirements, Data Extraction, Data Lakes, Data Modeling, Data Vault, Technical Requirements, and Warehouse Automation",Hybrid,,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3747035845,Recordly,https://www.linkedin.com/company/recordlydata/life,"Recordly · Tampere, Pirkanmaa, Finland  3 weeks ago  · 0 applicants",3 weeks ago,0,"
DATA ARCHITECTWould you like to be a part of Recordly's story? Now is your chance! We’re looking for a Data Architect eager to help businesses capitalize on the opportunities data offers. Working at Recordly means you get to work with customers that truly want to make data their competitive edge.“WHO/WHAT IS RECORDLY?” YOU MIGHT ASKRecordly is an independent company party of the Futurice family specializing in business data management. Our core business focuses on data management, data architectures, and hands-on data engineering that enable exceptional user experiences, efficiency gains, and new business models. In simple terms, we tech the heck out of data.Our employee promise (besides offering engaging customer assignments of course) includes the possibility to enjoy the company's success and shape who we are and what we do, together. We believe in being open about how the business is going and how the choices we make affect the bottom line. Take a look at our site to get to know us better.NOW TO THE ROLE ITSELFA Data Architect at Recordly typically works in tight cooperation with our customers within different assignments. Assignments vary and may sometimes even require hands-on work from time to time - meaning you may have to open up AWS/Azure/GCP Console and deploy some resources if needed or write some SQL lines when the Data Engineers are not around. As we focus on creating actual business value by creating or utilizing for example data platforms, we value the following skills:  Excellent communication skills both verbal and written, along with the ability to influence and demonstrate confidence in communications with senior-level management. Ability to understand and translate business requirements into data and technical requirements. - And we truly mean this. We want to be the glue, bridge, sellotape - whatever you want to call it - between the IT and business departments so that they understand each other.  Ability to cope with ever-evolving technologies used in the data domain and simultaneously understand the business and engineering side of new data products. - Yes, we know this sounds awful. The data domain is moving 88 miles per hour, making it difficult for anyone to keep up with, for example, what Apache Foundation is releasing next month. Fear not, however, we will help you with this with our continuous learning opportunities and hackathons. Working knowledge of Agile development, including DevOps and DataOps concepts. Finnish and English skills as some of our projects are in Finnish. 
Necessary technical skills:  Experience in designing and building hands-on and running highly available, distributed systems of data extraction, ingestion, and processing of large data sets. - We don’t mind if your experience is also from on-premise systems, as we know that the scalability pains are even higher over there. Experience with data modeling, data warehousing, and building high-volume ETL/ELT pipelines. - If star schemas or Data Vault or Data Warehouse Automation are familiar words to you, you’ll be fine.  Fluent with cloud infrastructure, especially the data side of the big three (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform) - We don’t expect you to be certified (we can help you with that), but work experience at least within one of the big three is needed. Understanding and/or experience with Data Lake infrastructure, Data Warehousing, and Data Analytics tools. - By this we mean, that you know what other tools (MDM, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage tools etc.) are needed for a good data platform and have some experience with those.
 WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOUWhen you join Recordly, you’ll be greeted by our open culture and awesome colleagues. On the more tangible side, we both want you to be able to pay your bills and take good care of yourself. We do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach.

Luottamus on tekemisemme ydin. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että datakonsultteina näemme roolimme ulottuvan neuvonnan ja palvelujen ulkopuolelle. Koska tiedämme, että digitaalisen luottamuksen, datan ja analytiikan, sovellusten ja integraatioiden asiantuntijuus on muutakin kuin teknistä tietämystä. Se on vastuu ja mahdollisuus auttaa ohjaamaan, muokkaamaan ja tekemään maailmasta oikeudenmukaisempaa meille kaikille. Mitä tulet tekemään?Data & Analytics -liiketoiminnallamme on pitkä kokemus analyyttisista sovelluksista, joissa suurten tietomassojen käsittely ja hallinta ovat arkipäivää.

DATA ARCHITECTWould you like to be a part of Recordly's story? Now is your chance! We’re looking for a Data Architect eager to help businesses capitalize on the opportunities data offers. Working at Recordly means you get to work with customers that truly want to make data their competitive edge.“WHO/WHAT IS RECORDLY?” YOU MIGHT ASKRecordly is an independent company party of the Futurice family specializing in business data management. Our core business focuses on data management, data architectures, and hands-on data engineering that enable exceptional user experiences, efficiency gains, and new business models. In simple terms, we tech the heck out of data.Our employee promise (besides offering engaging customer assignments of course) includes the possibility to enjoy the company's success and shape who we are and what we do, together. We believe in being open about how the business is going and how the choices we make affect the bottom line. Take a look at our site to get to know us better.NOW TO THE ROLE ITSELFA Data Architect at Recordly typically works in tight cooperation with our customers within different assignments. Assignments vary and may sometimes even require hands-on work from time to time - meaning you may have to open up AWS/Azure/GCP Console and deploy some resources if needed or write some SQL lines when the Data Engineers are not around. As we focus on creating actual business value by creating or utilizing for example data platforms, we value the following skills:  Excellent communication skills both verbal and written, along with the ability to influence and demonstrate confidence in communications with senior-level management. Ability to understand and translate business requirements into data and technical requirements. - And we truly mean this. We want to be the glue, bridge, sellotape - whatever you want to call it - between the IT and business departments so that they understand each other.  Ability to cope with ever-evolving technologies used in the data domain and simultaneously understand the business and engineering side of new data products. - Yes, we know this sounds awful. The data domain is moving 88 miles per hour, making it difficult for anyone to keep up with, for example, what Apache Foundation is releasing next month. Fear not, however, we will help you with this with our continuous learning opportunities and hackathons. Working knowledge of Agile development, including DevOps and DataOps concepts. Finnish and English skills as some of our projects are in Finnish. 
Necessary technical skills:  Experience in designing and building hands-on and running highly available, distributed systems of data extraction, ingestion, and processing of large data sets. - We don’t mind if your experience is also from on-premise systems, as we know that the scalability pains are even higher over there. Experience with data modeling, data warehousing, and building high-volume ETL/ELT pipelines. - If star schemas or Data Vault or Data Warehouse Automation are familiar words to you, you’ll be fine.  Fluent with cloud infrastructure, especially the data side of the big three (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform) - We don’t expect you to be certified (we can help you with that), but work experience at least within one of the big three is needed. Understanding and/or experience with Data Lake infrastructure, Data Warehousing, and Data Analytics tools. - By this we mean, that you know what other tools (MDM, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage tools etc.) are needed for a good data platform and have some experience with those.

Job DescriptionWe're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as a Business Intelligence Lead role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Developers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity and establish proper analytics teams in these domains.For an analytics leader, Wolt’s fast-moving business as a local three-sided marketplace offers a demanding but rewarding environment to grow one’s skills in modern analytics. You get to learn a lot, lead a team, grow a team, drive impact via analytics and work with the best people. What could be better than that?Domain overview: You wonder what Wolt Market is? It is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt’s well known delivery platform. Wolt Market delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing. In this domain, you’ll have exposure to end-to-end processes of running a quick commerce business, from supply chain optimization to improving consumer experience.Our humble expectationsAbout the role and our humble expectations:It’s all about passion for data, measuring impact and delivering insightsWhat we hope from you is that you first and foremost identify yourself as an analytics enthusiast. No matter what the subject of analysis is, you want to deeply understand the problem statement, mechanics of the business and data generation processes as well as impact via analytics. Coming up with ways to measure incremental business impact of the changes in our platform and operations is the key theme for Analytics at Wolt, and this role is instrumental in quantification of the changes. You will lead a team of Business Intelligence Developers who deeply care about designing and implementing scalable analytics solutions to various teams in the Wolt Market domain.What does success in these roles look like?Our stakeholders turn to Analytics for objective and reliable measurements and insights. Success in your domain area means that you together with your team members a) establish a solid and scalable reporting framework with your Product and Data stakeholders, b) provide Operations stakeholders with reliable tracking of the business metrics (that you help to design) and c) guide the design and implementation of automation needed for enabling the stakeholders as well as Analytics team members. Experience in the domain area is essential as we want to see a leader who’s not only passionate about analytics in general but also applying it in a certain domain.Will I get to do hands-on data work?We are looking for a lead who would split their time 50/50 between hands-on work and team leadership. While the role will be more hands-on initially, time used for team leadership may increase as the team grows. In general here at Wolt we value doers so even in senior leadership roles we value that if need be you can do the hands-on work.What if I don’t yet have experience in people leadership?We are primarily looking for people with experience in analytics leadership roles as we foresee that BI team in Wolt Market Analytics will continue growing. Hence we’re looking for people who know how to scale analytics organizations. At the same time, we are willing to consider candidates without prior experience in team leadership but who have a strong desire to grow to that role.Analytics is a team effortYou’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. As analytics is a team effort you have to be a cultural leader that cares for the wellbeing and constant improvement of your team members.Next StepsOur offering to you Lots of room to build the direction of analytics at Wolt.

The work consists of owning machine learning use cases as part of a product or business team; starting from identifying opportunities, to developing and prototyping a solution, all the way to deploying, maintaining, and improving a production-ready solution inside of the embedded product team. We use a variety of technologies and tools including Python, SQL, Spark, Docker and K8s, Snowflake, Looker, Flyte, Seldon Core, Airflow, MLflow and Kafka to get the job done, and constantly looking for ways to improve how our data scientists work. 💪💪We are looking for a data scientist to be embedded into our cross-functional Retail Platforms Pricing team, working together with engineers, product and analytics people, focusing on improving our pricing algorithms. The team is responsible for helping Wolt Market earn customer trust through attractive prices & discounts, especially on key value items that impact price perception disproportionately. Examples of the projects that we are excited about and would love to see you contribute towards include improving our pricing algorithms with machine learning, improving our experimentation platform for pricing, and markdown optimisation.You wonder what Wolt Market is?

We value diversity and we are a close network of some 230 professionals located in the heart of Helsinki. The atmosphere is international and our official working language is English.We are looking for a SENIOR RISK MANAGER - Model Validation Lead to join the Risk Management Office in Helsinki.As financial institutions heavily rely on models, it is imperative for them to understand and manage the risks surrounding the models that drive decision-making. At NIB, the change (in 2020) to a risk-based comprehensive framework for capital and liquidity management further highlighted the need for rigorous management of the risks related to models.Model risk is the potential loss an institution may incur as a consequence of decisions that are principally based on the output of models, due to errors in the development, implementation or use of such models.NIB is recruiting to lead the model validation activities. The key objectives of this function are to 1) help assure decision-makers that key models are reliable, “fit-for-purpose”, perform adequately and comply with internal policies and external expectations, 2) increase stakeholder understanding of model limitations and weaknesses, and 3) contribute to ongoing model improvements.Your role Maintain the model risk management framework (Policy and Guidelines)Maintain the model inventory and manage the model validation programmeDesign and oversee the model performance monitoring and control processRemediate/address findings from the third line of defense (Internal Audit)Assist and educate model owners and users to improve model diligence, including promoting and enforcing sound model development practices and documentation standardsDevelop and manage indicators used to monitor and report on model risksAssist to integrate model risk into operational risk (and non-financial risk) reportingMonitor regulatory developments and best practices for model risk managementIssue recommendations (e.g. mitigating actions) to model owners and users following validation exercises and/or documented observationsContribute thought leadership on model risk and data governance with key stakeholders

We also lead the integration of increasingly important non-financial sources of risk into the risk management mainstream, acting in the second line of defense role when it comes to macro-financial (systemic) risk, business & strategic risk, climate risk (and ESG), and model risk.As a Senior Risk Manager, you would lead the model validation activities.

"3 Postdoc positions in Ecology, evolution and statistical analysis of plant-microbe interactions","Bioinformatics, Biology, Ecology, Microbial Ecology, Pathology, Plant Biology, Plant Ecology, Plant Pathology, Soil, and Virus",Full-time,,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3749290834,University of Helsinki,https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-helsinki/life,"University of Helsinki · Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland  5 days ago  · 10 applicants",5 days ago,0,"
The Research Group of Prof. Anna-Liisa Laine seeks three post doctoral researchers for an ERC funded Advanced Grant project “Coevolutionary consequences of biodiversity change; Co-EvoChange”. The main aim of the project is to uncover how human-imposed disturbance in plant communities affects the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions both above- and below ground, and how these changes scale up to ecosystem processes. A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in plant-microbe interactions We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of above-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios. The selected candidate is expected to take part in designing their project and take full responsibility for its’ implementation from data collection to presentation of results in both scientific journals and conferences. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged. Postdoctoral position requirements:   The successful applicant should have a doctoral degree in plant ecology, plant biology, plant pathology, microbial ecology or similar  Previous experience working with questions and methods related to plant microbiome diversity, and the ecology and evolution of plant-microbe interactions  Analytical knowledge: Expertise in analyzing microbial community data – both bioinformatics and statistical inference - is considered an advantage  Excellent written and verbal communication skills  Ability to conceive, execute and complete research projects  Ability to think independently and creatively  Ability to work in a team and independently 
 A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in soil microbial ecology We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of below-ground plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plant communities. We are also interested in how altered plant-microbe associations translate to soil ecosystem processes such as decomposition, microbial community growth and carbon use efficiency. The planned work consists of survey and sampling of natural plant-microbe communities with known history of change, utilizing sequencing approached to characterize microbial communities, and field transplant as well as controlled experiments to identify key drivers of plant-microbe interactions at the community level under different disturbance scenarios.

 A post-doctoral researcher for a three-year position in ecological statistics We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study how microbial diversity and the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe interactions are altered following disturbance in wild plants communities. We will use a complementary analytical toolbox to identify how sensitive contemporary plant and microbial community structure and species interactions are to past biodiversity changes and environmental change. Relevant analytical approaches may include, but are not restricted to, Joint Species Distribution Model approaches (.g. HMSC; Sallinen et al. 2020), Random Markov Fields models (Norberg et al. 2023), and network analyses. The Ecological Memory framework can be used to quantify how much past plant biodiversity and environmental conditions affect contemporary plant-microbe associations and ecosystem functioning. Opportunities for professional development, e.g. in project management, leadership, mentoring, teaching and grant writing, are available and encouraged.  The successful applicant should have a doctoral degree in statistics, ecology or similar  Previous experience working with questions and methods as described above  Excellent written and verbal communication skills  Ability to conceive, execute and complete research projects  Ability to think independently and creatively  Ability to work in a team and independently

"Senior Python Backend Engineer, Courier Group","Analytical Skills, Back-End Web Development, Databases, Programming, and Python (Programming Language)Containerization, Microservices, PostgreSQL, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and System Performance",Remote,Full-time,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3741263342,Wolt,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wolt-oy/life,"Wolt · Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland  2 weeks ago  · 28 applicants",2 weeks ago,0,"
Job DescriptionAre you interested in being part of building a service that is unique to the tastes of our over 20 million users? Would you like to be in the midst of it all, learning, growing, and expanding into new verticals together with us? Does working with Python and Machine Learning and building things from scratch sound like something you’d like to do? If the answers to all 3 questions are “yes”, then great news since Wolt is looking for a Python Backend Engineer to join our Courier Logistics Estimation Team!The Logistics Estimation Team lies in one of the more complex parts of Wolt’s business - the logistics. This is because our logistics platform is responsible for courier task allocation and estimating delivery estimates that our customers, couriers, and merchants see. So, naturally, having a more efficient logistics platform would benefit everyone in our ecosystem: our Courier Partners, our merchants, and our customers. In this role you will be working closely with other backend engineers and data scientists as well as UX designers and frontend engineers who are working on quite a few interesting solutions. For one, right now we’re developing and deploying machine learning models for estimating different parts of the delivery process as well as designing and running experiments to evaluate their performance.As a backend engineer in this team you will have a big impact on and be a key player in building new estimate, forecast or dynamic pricing services from scratch, figuring out better ways to run Woltwide consumer-facing A/B tests, as well as helping our data scientists integrate their new ML-based models into our Python backend, and, of course, learning new things from your teammates along the way.So, if you’re an experienced Python engineer with a background in machine learning or similar field (e.g. data science), an interest in tackling scalability challenges, and building some real cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line. Also, you’ll get a chance to work closely together with our brilliant data scientists (seriously, this is a great chance to learn a lot about data science if you have a knack for it)!📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.Our humble expectations👉 You have fluent programing skills using modern Python, have experience setting up backend microservices, and building solid scalable services and well-structured applications using it.👉 You have experience working with machine learning or similar computational methods👉 You have experience working with Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration as well as familiarity with database technologies, such as PostgreSQL.👉 You have an analytical and curious way of thinking and are comfortable working with real-world data and its different nuances👉 Since the backend has mostly been written in Python (ofc) and Scala, if you have previous experience and willingness to tinker in the backend with Scala - even better, we consider that a plus!👉 Most importantly, you’re a dedicated person who is pragmatic with a positive attitude, who doesn't shy away from going outside of their comfort zone, and demonstrates curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.Next StepsThe position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!💯 Overall our product organization consists of a team of over 700 people at Wolt. We aim to build none other than the best-in-the-world engineering team here.💙 You’ll get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind, and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.🙌 Join us for an exciting journey! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Lina Muncyte (name.surname(at)wolt.com).About WoltWolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers.
